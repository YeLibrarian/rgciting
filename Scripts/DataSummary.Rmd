```{r initialanalysis, echo=FALSE}
source('PrelimStats.R')  #not working yet. needs to be fixed for the file path in read.table in the PrelimStats file. 

```

From Web of Science Cited Reference search, `r nrow(article_data)` records of cited reference containing "ResearchGate"" or "Research Gate" was retrieved on ---(filling in date). The number of articles cited these references were `r nrow(citing_data)`. 


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
