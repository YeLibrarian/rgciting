The effects of initiator type as 2,2'-Azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride (V-50), potassium persulfate (KPS), ammonium persulfate (APS), and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) on kinetics, particle size, and morphology were studied. It was observed that under the studied conditions, it is possible to form the inverse microemulsions using lower surfactant concentrations than those typically reported for microemulsin polymerization of this monomer. Z-average particle size (Dpz) of final latexes were in the range of 51 to 79 nm for BP, those corresponding to SP were in the interval of 118 to 225 nm, while Dpz of water-dispersed nanohydrogels varied from 530 to 825 nm conserving their spherical morphology. Particle size distributions of both latexes and the water-dispersed nanohydrogels were monomodal. High monomer conversions and fast polymerization rates were observed in all cases, achieving monomer-starved conditions when using low monomer addition rate in SP process.",NA,NA,NA,"CORONA RIVERA, MIGUEL ANGEL/O-5228-2014","CORONA RIVERA, MIGUEL ANGEL/0000-0001-9504-8506",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0303-402X","1435-1536",NA,NA,"DEC",2017,295,12,2395,2404,NA,"10.1007/s00396-017-4211-9",NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000414945700013",NA

Currently, service providers are relying more and more on securing data transferred between the service provider, namely the video streaming server, and the end user. However, securing video content includes at least the use of video encryption algorithm requiring processing and memory capabilities, provoking more delay and energy consumption. In any other context, energy consumption may not be a very important issue, but when using a mobile device, it will certainly become one. In this paper, we are dressing a comparison between different symmetric encryption algorithms, in terms of energy consumption, while decrypting and viewing a video stream on mobile device.","[Samet, Nouha; Ben Letaifa, Asma; Tabbane, Sami] Univ Carthage, MEDIATRON, Tunis, Tunisia; [Samet, Nouha; Ben Letaifa, Asma; Hamdi, Mohamed; Tabbane, Sami] SupCom, Higher Sch Commun Tunis, Ariana, Tunisia","Samet, N (reprint author), Univ Carthage, MEDIATRON, Tunis, Tunisia.; Samet, N (reprint author), SupCom, Higher Sch Commun Tunis, Ariana, Tunisia.","Nouha.samet@supcom.tn; asma.benletaifa@supcom.rnu.tn; mmh@supcom.rnu.tn; sami.tabbane@supcom.rnu.tn",NA,NA,11,0,0,4,4,"IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2376-6492",NA,"978-1-5090-4372-9","INT WIREL COMMUN",NA,2017,NA,NA,1350,1355,NA,NA,6,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BJ7BB","WOS:000426991500229","2018-07-13"

Only three (E. indica, C. dactylon, and A. sessilis) of the six species survived while the others died 1 month after the beginning of experimentations. The relative growth indexes showed a strong similarity between the growth parameters of E. indica and C. dactylon, each on polluted and control soils, unlike A. sessilis. Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) removal efficiency were 82.56, 80.69, and 77% on soil planted with E. indica, C. dactylon, and A. sessilis, respectively; and 57.25% on non-planted soil. According to the bioconcentration and translocation factors, E. indica and A. sessilis are involved on rhizodegradation and phytoextraction of hydrocarbons whereas C. dactylon is only involved into rhizodegradation.

ABI patients usually stop receiving cognitive treatment when leaving the rehabilitation facility or shortly thereafter, due to the high cost of therapy sessions and the mobility requirement to access therapy. Software solutions offer a promising tool for accessible and affordable cognitive rehabilitation in the home environment. However, research provides limited evidence for effective transfer of benefits from computerized cognitive training to real-life functions. Virtual reality (VR) exergames using motion-interaction offer a more realistic and natural training environment, and are therefore expected to facilitate a more effective transfer. Although commercial exergames may bring about some cognitive gains, they usually do not target cognitive functions directly. Here we describe a novel exergames platform, the Active Brain Trainer (ABT), designed to directly target EF, using games in multiple realistic contexts. The software adapts in real-time to the patient's behavior, providing feedback and rewards, and hence may enhance usability and compliance. The primary goal of the current study is to assess the feasibly and acceptability of this platform for community-dwelling ABI patients during the chronic phase. A secondary goal is to assess the initial efficacy on EF and functional benefits from program training. Participants were instructed to use the games for 15-20 sessions. Neuropsychological assessments of EF and daily life functions were performed before and after training. Participants also filled a satisfaction questionnaire following training. All training and assessments were conducted in the participants' homes. Game performance was recorded throughout training sessions. Preliminary results from the six ABI patients who successfully completed the program so far show no adverse effects. Participants reported enjoyment and satisfaction from training. Participants performed increasingly more challenging EF tasks within game environments. Initial results show improvements in functional tasks and most executive neuropsychological assessments following training. Additional participants are currently being trained to increase the power of the results. These preliminary findings support the feasibility and potential efficacy of the motion-based cognitive training of EF for community-dwelling individuals with ABI.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"978-1-5090-3053-8",NA,NA,2017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000411111900075",NA
