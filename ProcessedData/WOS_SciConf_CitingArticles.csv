Rats with bilateral lesions of the MrD either immediate or 24 h after training in Y-maze were found to have decrease in correct runs in both groups. However, animals with transected afferent and efferent nerve bundles to isolate the Hip immediately or 24 h after training in Y-maze were found to show a decrease in correct runs only in the group injured immediately after Y-maze training but not in the 24 h group suggesting that MrD is likely involved in the entire process of long-term memory consolidation whereas the Hip only contributes to memory in the early stage. In addition, animals treated with a NMDA receptor (NMDAR) blocker, e.g. MK-801, showed decreased correct runs in Y-maze test and in expression level of phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) in neurons of the MrD but not in the Hip. Furthermore, animals treated with okadaic acid (OA), a potent protein phosphatase 1 inhibitor, showed increased correct runs in the Y-maze test. The expression level of pCREB and c-Fos and c-Jun was found increased in neurons of the MrD and the Hip in response to OA treatment. In conclusion, NMDAR and pCREB are involved in memory functions of both the Hip and the MrD. NMDAR might regulate pCREB level in neurons of the MrD but not in the Hip.

By assessing the correlation between [O(2)Hb] and [HHb] in task-evoked activity as well as resting-state data, we identified a spatial dependency of non-neuronal hemodynamic changes in the anterior temporal region of the human head.

Methods: The descriptive analysis used a framework operationalizing Starfield's classic primary care model for health services research. A scoping review was performed using relevant sources, and expert consultations were conducted for completing and validating data. Results: The descriptive analysis presents a complex narrative of a primary care system undergoing classical developmental processes of transitioning middle-income countries. The system is simultaneously under tremendous pressure to adapt to the continuously changing, complex and resource-intensive needs of sub-populations exhibiting varying morbidity patterns, within the context of protracted security, humanitarian, economic, and political crises. Despite exhibiting significant resilience in the face of the ongoing crises, the continued influx of IDPs and Syrian refugees, coupled with extremely limited resources and weak governance at policy, organizational and clinical levels threaten the sustainability of KRI's public primary care system. Diverse trajectories to the strengthening and development of primary care are underway by local and international actors, notably the World Bank, RAND Corporation, UN organizations and USAID, focusing on varying imperatives related to the protracted humanitarian and economic crises. Conclusions: The convergence, interaction and outcomes of the diverse initiatives and policy approaches in relation to the development of KRI's primary care system are complex and highly uncertain. A common vision of primary care is required to align resources, initiatives and policies, and to enable synergy between all local and international actors involved in the developmental and humanitarian response.

To better clarify the contribution of the microbiome of grape fruits during wine fermentation, we used high-throughput sequencing to identify bacterial and fungi communities associated with berries and musts of Cannonau. This is the most important cultivar-wine of Sardinia (Italy) where most vineyards are cultivated without phytochemical treatments. Results suggested that microbiomes of berries collected at four different localities share a core composition characterized by Enterobacteriales, Pseudomonadales, Bacillales, and Rhodospirillales. However, any area seems to enrich berries microbiome with peculiar microbial traits. For example, berries belonging to the biodynamic vineyards of Mamoiada were rich in Bacillales typical of manure (i.e. Lysinibacillus, Bacillus, and Sporosarcina), whereas in the Santadi locality, berries showed soil bacteria such as Pasteurellales and Bacteroidales as well as Rhodospirillales and Lactobacillales which are commonly involved in wine fermentation. In the case of fungi, the most abundant taxa were Dothioraceae, Pleosporaceae, and Saccharomycodaceae, and although the proportion of these families varied among localities, they occurred ubiquitously in all vineyards. During vinification processes performed at the same wine cellar under controlled conditions and without using any yeast starter, more than 50% of bacteria groups of berries reached musts, and each locality had its own private bacteria signature, even if Saccharomyces cerevisiae represented the most abundant fungal species. This work suggests that natural berries microbiome could be influenced by pedoclimatic and anthropologic conditions (e.g., farming management), and the fruits' microorganisms persist during the fermentation process. For these reasons, a reliable wine genotyping should include the entire holobiont (plant and all its symbionts), and bioprospecting activities on grape microbiota could lead to improved viticulture yields and wine quality.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1932-6203,NA,NA,NA,NA,11-Sep,2017,12,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,e0184615,10.1371/journal.pone.0184615,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000410243200019,28892512,NA,NA,NA,NA

Marine conservation areas require high levels of compliance to meet conservation objectives, yet little research has assessed compliance quantitatively, especially for recreational fishers. Recreational fishers take 12% of global annual fish catches. With millions of people fishing from small boats, this fishing sector is hard to monitor, making accurate quantification of non-compliance an urgent research priority. 2. Shore-based remote camera monitoring was tested for quantifying recreational non-compliance in near-shore, coastal rockfish conservation areas (RCAs) in the Salish Sea, Canada. 3. Six high definition trail cameras were used to monitor 42 locations between July and August 2014. 4. Seventy-nine percent of monitored conservation area sites showed confirmed or probable fishing activity, with no significant difference in fishing effort inside and outside RCAs. 5. Mixed effects generalized linear models were used to test environmental and geographic factors influencing compliance.

In this paper, we propose a method to measure end-to-end path latency in Software Defined Networks (SDN). This method avoids redundant work and measures latency in real-time. Our proposal is an improvement over the looping technique. We simplified the looping technique by using IP TTL as a counter. In order to avoid duplicate work, latency is measured per link and stored in the controller. End systems may register their flow labels with the SDN controller to receive latency information. For each registered flow, controller composes individual link latencies on that path to compute end-to-end latency.

For each office and location, annual simulations were performed with combinations of fixed ventilation ranging 20-100 CFM/occ (9.4-47 L/s/occ) and filters ranging in efficiency corresponding to MERV 8-16 and HEPA. Energy use was monetized using historic costs, and PM2.5 and ozone exposures were monetized using incidence valuations and concentration-response functions. These outcomes were combined into a singular cost function, which was characterized empirically as a fiinction of ventilation and filtration. Various partial derivatives of the cost function were calculated to observe trends and interdependencies. Exposure cost was 5.5 times higher than energy cost for cases with common filters (MERV 8-11). Even with high filter efficiency, exposure cost was greater than energy cost on average. Filtration had a much stronger effect than ventilation on indoor contaminant levels and the total cost function. The differential analysis revealed that ventilation and filtration complement each other: Implementing a high efficiency filter can mitigate negative effects of ventilation, and higher ventilation rates can increase the efficacy of filtration (e.g. increasing ventilation from 20 to 60 CFM/occ increased filtration efficacy by 1.2-1.5 for VAV offices).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0360-1323,1873-684X,NA,NA,NA,15-Jan,2018,128,NA,NA,NA,NA,320,335,NA,10.1016/j.buildenv.2017.10.025,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000423004900028,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In addition, we have only little empirical knowledge of the actual tie strengthening process in online social networks.

The time domain solution of such models is usually performed using nodal voltages and branch currents, or sometimes charge and currents. The present paper describes a possible alternative approach, which can be obtained expressing and solving the problem in the waves domain. The digital wave theory is used to find an equivalent representation of the PEEC circuit in the wave domain. Through a pertinent continuous to discrete time transformation, the constitutive relations for partial inductances, capacitances, and resistances are translated in an explicit form. The combination of such equations with Kirchhoff laws allows to achieve a semiexplicit resolution scheme. Three different physical configurations are analyzed and their extracted digital wave PEEC models are simulated at growing sizes using the general-purpose digital wave simulator.

This paper aims at finding optimal solutions for the stochastic DLBP. Two second-order cone programming (SOCP1 and SOCP2) models and five piecewise linear mixed integer programming (PwLP) models are presented. The PwLP formulations involve two specially ordered sets of type 2 (S1 and S2) models and three convex combination (CC1, CC2 and CC3) models. In each modelling category, the latter models strengthen the initial S1 and CC1 models. Our computational analysis of a total 240 instances of ten problems demonstrates that all the seven models can be used to solve practical-sized DLBP problems to optimality using GUROBI. The SOCP2 model and the strengthened S2 and CC2 models lead to lower computation times, compared to SOCP1, S1, CC1 and CC3, respectively. Using the strengthened S2 and CC2 formulations, the CPU times of the CC3 model available in the literature can be reduced by 50 and 40%, respectively. Besides analysing the optimal solutions and the differences of the computation times, we present insights gained from our results.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0020-7543,1366-588X,NA,NA,NA,NA,2017,55,24,NA,NA,NA,7412,7434,NA,10.1080/00207543.2017.1351639,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000423135100010,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The primary purpose of this study was to determine the domains of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) model and levels of evidence for yoga and adults with stroke and multiple sclerosis (MS), and children. A secondary purpose was to decide whether any inferences could be made for children with CP. Design: This study included a meta-analysis. Interventions: A systematic review was performed of yoga and said populations. Outcome measures were categorized according to the ICF model domains of body structures and function, activity, and quality of life. Effect sizes (ESs) were calculated by using Cohen's d. Since there were few commonalities among outcome measures and reporting of outcomes within and among diagnostic groups, direct comparisons of ESs were difficult. Hence, we chose to evaluate the impact of yoga as compared with the control group or other physical exercise by using a General Linear Mixed Model. Results: There were 5 yoga studies with stroke, 15 with MS, and 12 with children. Studies with children used outcomes related to body structure and function, whereas those with stroke and MS used outcomes across all three domains of the ICF. ESs varied from negligible to medium for stroke, from negligible to large for MS and children. Conclusions: The findings of this meta-analysis indicate that yoga is no better or worse than other exercise modalities as a treatment intervention for adults with stroke and MS, and children. Group yoga classes are typically social environments that can contribute to increased physical progress and feelings that contribute to quality of life, which may benefit individuals with CP.

Arthropod predators increased in response to reductions in ant and bird access, but the overall effect of experimental manipulations on ecosystem functions was minimal.

Pairwise measures of neutral genetic differentiation are supposed to contain information about past and ongoing dispersal events and are thus often used as dependent variables in correlative analyses to elucidate how neutral genetic variation is affected by landscape connectivity. However, spatial heterogeneity in the intensity of genetic drift, stemming from variations in population sizes, may inflate variance in measures of genetic differentiation and lead to erroneous or incomplete interpretations in terms of connectivity. Here, we tested the efficiency of two distance-based metrics designed to capture the unique influence of spatial heterogeneity in local drift on genetic differentiation. These metrics are easily computed from estimates of effective population sizes or from environmental proxies for local carrying capacities, and allow us to introduce the hypothesis of Spatial-Heterogeneity-in-Effective-Population-Sizes (SHNe). SHNe can be tested in a way similar to isolation-by-distance or isolation-by-resistance within the classical landscape genetics hypothesis-testing framework. 2. We used simulations under various models of population structure to investigate the reliability of these metrics to quantify the unique contribution of SHNe in explaining patterns of genetic differentiation. We then applied these metrics to an empirical genetic dataset obtained for a freshwater fish (Gobio occitaniae). 3. Simulations showed that SHNe explained up to 60% of variance in genetic differentiation (measured as F-st) in the absence of gene flow, and up to 20% when migration rates were as high as 0.10. Furthermore, one of the two metrics was particularly robust to uncertainty in the estimation of effective population sizes (or proxies for carrying capacity). In the empirical dataset, the effect of SHNe on spatial patterns of F-st was five times higher than that of isolation-by-distance, uniquely contributing to 41% of variance in pairwise F-st. Taking the influence of SHNe into account also allowed decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio, and improving the upper estimate of effective dispersal distance. 4. We conclude that the use of SHNe metrics in landscape genetics will substantially improve the understanding of evolutionary drivers of genetic variation, providing substantial information as to the actual drivers of patterns of genetic differentiation in addition to traditional measures of Euclidean distance or landscape resistance.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Prunier, Jerome/0000-0003-4110-2567; Chikhi, Lounes/0000-0002-1140-0718",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2041-210X,2041-2096,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2017,8,12,NA,NA,NA,1866,1877,NA,10.1111/2041-210X.12820,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000417239200023,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the past few years, many researchers conducted laboratory experiments to 1) observe various processes by which water imbibes into shale rocks, and 2) understand the mechanisms behind each process that contributes to fluid uptake in shale. Although there is consistency in most of the observations that control the liquid filling in shales, some issues remain in regards to wettability. Many mechanisms seem to be contributing to liquid filling in the laboratory experiments, but there is no consensus on the dominant mechanisms. Even though some observations from field provide consistent signatures, we do not yet have a verified answer for the geo-mechanisms behind those observations. This paper provides a critical review of the observations (laboratory and field), the mechanisms behind those observations, and the models to mimic the imbibition behavior of shales.

Here, we present Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) version 1.1, a global P dataset for the period 1979-2015 with a 3hourly temporal and 0.25 degrees ffi spatial resolution, specifically designed for hydrological modeling. The design philosophy of MSWEP was to optimally merge the highest quality P data sources available as a function of timescale and location. The long-term mean of MSWEP was based on the CHPclim dataset but replaced with more accurate regional datasets where available. A correction for gauge under-catch and orographic effects was introduced by inferring catchment-average P from streamflow (Q) observations at 13 762 stations across the globe. The temporal variability of MSWEP was determined by weighted averaging of P anomalies from seven datasets; two based solely on interpolation of gauge observations (CPC Unified and GPCC), three on satellite remote sensing (CMORPH, GSMaP-MVK, and TMPA 3B42RT), and two on atmospheric model reanalysis (ERA-Interim and JRA-55). For each grid cell, the weight assigned to the gauge-based estimates was calculated from the gauge network density, while the weights assigned to the satellite-and reanalysis-based estimates were calculated from their comparative performance at the surrounding gauges. The quality of MSWEP was compared against four state-of-the-art gauge-adjusted P datasets (WFDEI-CRU, GPCP-1DD, TMPA 3B42, and CPC Unified) using independent P data from 125 FLUXNET tower stations around the globe. MSWEP obtained the highest daily correlation coefficient (R) among the five P datasets for 60.0% of the stations and a median R of 0.67 vs. 0.44-0.59 for the other datasets. We further evaluated the performance of MSWEP using hydrological modeling for 9011 catchments (< 50 000 km(2)) across the globe. Specifically, we calibrated the simple conceptual hydrological model HBV (Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning) against daily Q observations with P from each of the different datasets. For the 1058 sparsely gauged catchments, representative of 83.9% of the global land surface (excluding Antarctica), MSWEP obtained a median calibration NSE of 0.52 vs. 0.29-0.39 for the other P datasets.

Overcoming this limitation is exactly what we are concerned about in this paper. We describe a very different segmentation method based on a cascade-AdaBoost-SVM classifier. This classifier works with a vessel axis + cross-section model, which constrains the classifier around the vessel. This has the potential to be both physiologically accurate and computationally effective. To further increase the segmentation accuracy, we organize the AdaBoost classifiers and the Support VectorMachine (SVM) classifiers in a cascade way. And we substitute the AdaBoost classifier with the SVM classifier under special circumstances to overcome the overfitting issue of the AdaBoost classifier. The performance of our method is evaluated on synthetic complex-structured datasets, where we obtain high overlap ratios, around 91%. We also validate the proposed method on one challenging case, segmentation of carotid arteries over real clinical datasets. The performance of our method is promising, since our method yields better results than two state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic datasets and real clinical datasets.","[Hu, Xin; Chu, Dianhui] Harbin Inst Technol Weihai, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Weihai 264209, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Yuanzhi] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Ding, Deqiong] Harbin Inst Technol Weihai, Dept Math, Weihai 264209, Peoples R China","Hu, X (reprint author), Harbin Inst Technol Weihai, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Weihai 264209, Peoples R China.; Cheng, YZ (reprint author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",hithuxin@hit.edu.cn; yzcheng@hitwh.edu.cn,NA,NA,"Special Fund for Key Program of Science and Technology of Shandong Province, China [2015ZDXX0201B02]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [HIT.NSRIF.201713]; China Scholarship Council","This work was supported by the Special Fund for Key Program of Science and Technology of Shandong Province, China (Grant 2015ZDXX0201B02), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant no.

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether rehabilitative digital gaming facilitates cognitive functioning and general well-being in people with TBI. Methods: A total of 90 Finnish-speaking adults with TBI (18-65 years) were recruited from an outpatient neuroscience clinic. The participants were randomly allocated to one of the three groups: a rehabilitation gaming group (n=29, intervention), an entertainment gaming group (n=29, active control), or a passive control group (n=32). The gaming groups were instructed to engage in gaming for a minimum of 30 min per day for 8 weeks. Primary and secondary outcomes were measured at three time points: before the intervention, after the intervention, and 3 months following the intervention. The primary outcome was cognitive status measured by processing speed and visuomotor tasks (The Trail Making Test; Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition, WAIS-IV, symbol search, coding, and cancellation tasks). Secondary outcomes were attention and executive functions (Simon task), working memory (WAIS-IV digit span and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, PASAT), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), self-efficacy (General Self-efficacy Scale), and executive functions (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version). Feasibility information was assessed (acceptability, measurement instruments filled, dropouts, adherence, usability, satisfaction, and possible future use). Cognitive measurements were conducted in face-to-face interviews by trained psychologists, and questionnaires were self-administered. Results: The effects of rehabilitation gaming did not significantly differ from the effects of entertainment gaming or being in a passive control group. For primary outcomes and PASAT tests, the participants in all three groups showed overall improvement in test scores across the three measurement points. However, depression scores increased significantly between baseline and after 8 weeks and between baseline and after 3 months in the rehabilitative gaming group. No differences were found in patients' self-efficacy between the three measuring points in any of the groups. Participants did use the games (rehabilitation group: 93%, 27/29; entertainment group 100%, 29/29). Games were seen as a usable intervention (rehabilitation group: 70%, 14/29; entertainment group: 83%, 20/29). The rehabilitation group was less satisfied with the gaming intervention (68%, 13/29 vs 83%, 20/29), but they were more willing to use the game after the intervention period (76%, 16/29 vs 63%, 15/29). Total time spent on gaming during the intervention period was low (15.22 hour rehabilitation gaming group, 19.22 hour entertainment gaming group). Conclusions: We did not find differences between the groups in improvement in the outcome measures. The improvements in test performance by all three groups may reflect rehearsal effects.

Active virtual reality gaming (AVG) may be useful for children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) to practice motor skills if their movement patterns are of good quality while engaged in AVG. Objective. This study aimed to examine: (1) the quality of motor patterns of children with DCD participating in AVG by comparing them with children with typical development (TD) and (2) whether differences existed in the motor patterns utilized with 2 AVG types: Sony Play Station 3 Move and Microsoft Xbox 360 Kinect. Design. This was a quasi-experimental, biomechanical laboratory- based study. Methods. Twenty-one children with DCD, aged 10 to 12 years, and 19 age- and sex-matched children with TD played a match of table tennis on each AVG type. Hand path, wrist angle, and elbow angle were recorded using a motion analysis system. Linear mixed-model analyses were used to determine differences between DCD and TD groups and Move and Kinect AVG type for forehands and backhands. Results. Children with DCD utilized a slower hand path speed (backhand mean difference [MD]=1.20 m/s; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]=0.41, 1.98); greater wrist extension (forehand MD=34.3; 95% CI=22.6, 47.0); and greater elbow flexion (forehand MD=22.3'; 95% CI=7.4, 37.1) compared with children with TD when engaged in AVG. There also were differences in movement patterns utilized between AVG types. Limitations. Only simple kinematic measures were compared, and no data regarding movement outcome were assessed.

Using virtual environments (VE) allows for the dissociation of visual and inertial inputs to manipulate human behavioral outputs. Our goal was to employ VE technology in a novel manner to investigate how head stabilization is affected by spatiotemporal properties of dynamic visual input when combined with passive motion on a linear sled. Healthy adults (n = 12) wore a head-mounted display during naso-occipital sinusoidal horizontal whole body translations while seated. Subjects were secured in a seat with a five-point harness, with the head free to move. Frequency and amplitude of sinusoidal input (i.e., inertial conditions) were set to create overlapping conditions of maximum acceleration (a(max)) or velocity (v(max)). Four inertial conditions were combined with four visual conditions (VIS). VIS were created so that direction of optic flow either matched direction of passive motion or did not. The effect of near and far fixation distance within the VE was also tested. Head kinematics were collected with a three-axis gyro. Head stability showed a complex interaction dependent on changes in weighting of visual and inertial inputs that changed with the sled driving frequency. Inertial condition affected amplitude (p < 0.0000) and phase (p < 0.0000) of head pitch angular velocity. In the absence of visual input, head pitch velocity amplitude increased (p < 0.01). An interaction effect between inertial and VIS conditions on head yaw occurred in SW (p < 0.05). There was also a significant interaction of depth of field and inertial condition on amplitude (p < 0.001) and phase (p < 0.05) of head yaw velocity in SW, especially during high conditions. We conclude visual flow can organize lateral cervical responses despite being discordant with inertial input.

A study was carried out to describe the nutritional and reproductive behavior of two-to-four parturition crossbred cows (Gyr (Bos indicus) x Holstein (Bos taurus)) divided in two groups according to their calving to first service interval (CFSI): Group 1: <= 50 days CFSI, n= 7; Group 2: <= 50 days CFSI, n= 8.

This study aims to reduce MSWS-12 measurement error and facilitate computerized adaptive testing by creating an IRT model of the MSWS-12 and distributing it online. Methods MSWS-12 responses from 284 subjects with MS were collected by mail and used to fit and compare several IRT models. Following model selection and assessment, subpopulations based on age and sex were tested for differential item functioning (DIF). Results Model comparison favored a one-dimensional graded response model (GRM). This model met fit criteria and explained 87 % of response variance. The performance of each MSWS-12 item was characterized using category response curves (CRCs) and item information. IRT-based MSWS-12 scores correlated with traditional MSWS-12 scores (r = 0.99) and timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) speed (r= -0.70). Item 2 showed DIF based on age (chi(2) = 19.02, df = 5, p < 0.01), and Item 11 showed DIF based on sex (chi(2) = 13.76, df = 5, p = 0.02). Conclusions MSWS-12 measurement error depends on walking ability, but could be lowered by improving or replacing items with low information or DIF.

However, excess caution in decision making may also lead to better performance in specific situations where the cost of extended deliberation is small. We compared 16 juvenile OCD patients with 16 matched healthy controls whilst they performed a sequential information gathering task under different external cost conditions. We found that patients with OCD outperformed healthy controls, winning significantly more points. The groups also differed in the number of draws required prior to committing to a decision, but not in decision accuracy. A novel Bayesian computational model revealed that subjective sampling costs arose as a non-linear function of sampling, closely resembling an escalating urgency signal. Group difference in performance was best explained by a later emergence of these subjective costs in the OCD group, also evident in an increased decision threshold.

Based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), nutrient loads coupled with population density and water quality requirements are regarded as multi-factors for CSAs identification in Xiangxi river watershed, the first tributary of the Yangtze River. The results based on the calibrated model found that the subbasins heavily and seriously polluted by nutrient loads were different from the subbasins identified as CSAs, demonstrating integrating socio-economic factors like population density and water quality requirements to identify CSAs is of much necessity. The CSAs occupied 19.7% of the total subbasins, and accounted for 53% total nitrogen loads, 54% total phosphorus loads and 36% of the total population. Considering the model calibration and validation will take a long time as well as data deficiency in some subbasins, the influence of uncalibrated SWAT on CSAs identifications was discussed. The comparative results between CSAs identification with calibrated and uncalibrated SWAT model revealed that model calibration had little effect on nutrients distribution and CSAs locations in the study area. Uncalibrated SWAT model may be applied when the research objective is less related to model calibration. The results will be greatly effective for CSAs identification and NPS pollution control at a basin scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Batteries are often based on redox materials with low power capability and safety concerns in some cases. Supercapacitors, particularly those based on redox inactive materials, e.g. activated carbon, can offer high power output, but have relatively low energy capacity. Combining the merits of supercapacitor and battery into a hybrid, the supercapattery can possess energy as much as the battery and output a power almost as high as the supercapacitor. Redox electrode materials are essential in the supercapattery design. However, it is hard to utilise these materials easily because of their intrinsic characteristics, such as the low conductivity of metal oxides and the poor mechanical strength of conducting polymers. This article offers a brief introduction of redox electrode materials, the basics of supercapattery and its relationship with pseudocapacitors, and reviews selectively some recent progresses in the relevant research and development.

The design of tools providing regional estimates of evapotranspiration (ET), one of the most relevant water balance fluxes, may help the sustainable management of water resources. Remote sensing provides periodic data about actual vegetation temporal dynamics (through the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) and water availability under water stress (through the surface temperature T-surf), which are crucial factors controlling ET. In this study, spatially distributed estimates of ET (or its energy equivalent, the latent heat flux LE) in the Kairouan plain (central Tunisia) were computed by applying the Soil Plant Atmosphere and Remote Sensing Evapotranspiration (SPARSE) model fed by low-resolution remote sensing data (Terra and Aqua MODIS). The work's goal was to assess the operational use of the SPARSE model and the accuracy of the modeled (i) sensible heat flux (H) and (ii) daily ET over a heterogeneous semiarid landscape with complex land cover (i.e., trees, winter cereals, summer vegetables). SPARSE was run to compute instantaneous estimates of H and LE fluxes at the satellite overpass times. The good correspondence (R-2 = 0.60 and 0.63 and RMSE = 57.89 and 53.85 W m(-2) for Terra and Aqua, respectively) between instantaneous H estimates and large aperture scintillometer (XLAS) H measurements along a path length of 4 km over the study area showed that the SPARSE model presents satisfactory accuracy. Results showed that, despite the fairly large scatter, the instantaneous LE can be suitably estimated at large scales (RMSE D 47.20 and 43.20 W m(-2) for Terra and Aqua, respectively, and R-2 = 0.55 for both satellites). Additionally, water stress was investigated by comparing modeled (SPARSE) and observed (XLAS) water stress values; we found that most points were located within a 0.2 confidence interval, thus the general tendencies are well reproduced.

Retrieval from satellites of the surface soil moisture has produced global coverage of multiannual time series data, thereby allowing the application of techniques that require long time series of daily data. We applied two techniques from river hydrology to soil moisture data from the advanced scatterometer aboard the meteorological operational satellite: (1) baseflow separation; and (2) master recession curve (MRC) with the correlation method. The former filtered the data and extracted those for the base soil moisture (BSM), which is considered the water that circulates in the soil by capillarity. The latter technique allowed the estimation of recession constants by the extraction of continuously decreasing BSM segments. The use of MRC for a large range of BSM provides a recession constant representative of all the moisture decrease for each pixel, thereby permitting the identification of drought-sensitive zones. The recession constant, a metric that had not been used for soil moisture, allowed us to determine potential temporal evolution of drought in the Yucatan peninsula.

Since many farmers in this area do not have enough water to meet the seasonal water requirements of crops like corn and soybean, maximizing yield produced per unit of water under deficit irrigation conditions is becoming increasingly important. This study was conducted to quantify the grain yield response of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr] to deficit irrigation, and to determine which seasonal water variables correlated best to soybean grain yield under deficit irrigation. The study was conducted during 2002 at Curtis, and 2003 and 2004 at North Platte, Nebraska. Nine deficit irrigation treatments, including different irrigation amounts and timings, were studied in 2002 and 2003, and eight treatments were studied in 2004. Soybean grain yields across years and sites were best related to the seasonal ratio of the actual crop evapotranspiration and the crop evapotranspiration when soil water was not limiting (ETd/ETw), and to the seasonal ratio of actual crop transpiration and crop transpiration when soil water was not limiting (T-d/T-w) Both of these seasonal ratios were linearly related to grain yield with R-2 = 0.91 when combining data for all seasons. The crop water productivity (CWP) (yield per unit of seasonal ETd) linearly increased with both ETd/ETw (R-2 = 0.72) and T-d/T-w (R-2 = 0.72), but was best correlated to the daily positive difference between the actual and the theoretical fraction of total available soil water in the root zone that can be depleted before crop water stress occurred, accumulated for the entire season (seasonal p(diff)) (R-2 = 0.77). A linear relationship between the cumulative ET, and fraction of season (function of days after emergence) was found. This relationship developed for a given location could be used to extrapolate seasonal ETw for in-season irrigation management. Poor correlation was found between CWP and other variables such as total irrigation, rain + irrigation, and total water The results of this study can provide useful information for soybean irrigators to make better management decisions under deficit irrigation conditions.",NA,NA,NA,"Payero, Jose/A-7916-2011",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0001-2351,NA,NA,NA,NA,NOV-DEC,2005,48,6,NA,NA,NA,2189,2203,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000234953000017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To assess this question, air-water fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were quantified for humic lakes and their inlet streams in four boreal catchments using a before-after control-impact experiment. Two catchments were treated with forest clear-cuts followed by site preparation (18 % and 44 % of the catchment area). GHG fluxes and hydrological and physicochemical water characteristics were measured at multiple locations in lakes and streams at high temporal resolution throughout the summer season over a 4-year period. Both lakes and streams evaded all GHGs. The treatment did not significantly change GHG fluxes in streams or lakes within 3 years after the treatment, despite significant increases of CO2 and CH4 concentrations in hillslope groundwater. Our results highlight that GHGs leaching from forest clear-cuts may be buffered in the riparian zone-stream continuum, likely acting as effective biogeochemical processors and wind shelters to prevent additional GHG evasion via downstream inland waters.

Understanding this interplay in diverse basin types at different timescales is required to adequately place lakes into the global carbon cycle and predict CO2 flux through space and time. We analyzed 18years of data from seven moderately hard lakes in an agricultural prairie landscape in central Canada. We applied generalized additive models and sensitivity analyses to evaluate the roles of metabolic and climatic drivers in regulating CO2 flux at the intra-annual scale. At mean conditions with respect to other predictors, metabolic controls resulted in uptake of atmospheric CO2 when surface waters exhibited moderate primary production but released CO2 only when primary production was very low (<8g/L or when dissolved nitrogen was elevated (>2,000g/L), implying that respiratory controls offset photosynthetic CO2 uptake under these conditions. Climatically, dry conditions increased the likelihood of in-gassing, likely due to evaporative concentration of base cations and/or reduced allochthonous carbon loads. While more research is required to establish the relative importance of climate and metabolism at other timescales (diel, autumn/winter), we conclude that these hard fresh waters characteristic of continental interiors are mainly affected by metabolic drivers of pCO(2) at daily-monthly timescales, are climatically controlled at interannual intervals, and are more likely to in-gas CO2 for a given level of algal abundance than are soft water, boreal ecosystems.",NA,NA,NA,"Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013","Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307; Hayes, Nicole/0000-0002-5664-9939; Simpson, Gavin/0000-0002-9084-8413; Haig, Heather/0000-0002-0208-8179",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2169-8953,2169-8961,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2018,123,6,NA,NA,NA,1940,1959,NA,10.1029/2018JG004506,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000438667200011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The magnitudes of these fluxes and the processes driving them are still uncertain, particularly for subarctic and Arctic lakes where direct measurements of CH4 and CO2 emissions are often of low temporal resolution and are rarely sustained throughout the entire year. Using the eddy covariance method, we measured surface-atmosphere exchange of CH4 and CO2 during 2.5 years in a thawed fen and a shallow lake of a subarctic peatland complex. Gas exchange at the fen exhibited the expected seasonality of a subarctic wetland with maximum CH4 emissions and CO2 uptake in summer, as well as low but continuous emissions of CH4 and CO2 throughout the snow-covered winter. The seasonality of lake fluxes differed, with maximum CO2 and CH4 flux rates recorded at spring thaw. During the ice-free seasons, we could identify surface CH4 emissions as mostly ebullition events with a seasonal trend in the magnitude of the release, while a net CO2 flux indicated photosynthetic activity. We found correlations between surface CH4 emissions and surface sediment temperature, as well as between diel CO2 uptake and diel solar input. During spring, the breakdown of thermal stratification following ice thaw triggered the degassing of both CH4 and CO2. This spring burst was observed in 2 consecutive years for both gases, with a large inter-annual variability in the magnitude of the CH4 degassing. On the annual scale, spring emissions converted the lake from a small CO2 sink to a CO2 source: 80% of total annual carbon emissions from the lake were emitted as CO2. The annual total carbon exchange per unit area was highest at the fen, which was an annual sink of carbon with respect to the atmosphere. Continuous respiration during the winter partly counteracted the fen summer sink by accounting for, as both CH4 and CO2, 33% of annual carbon exchange. Our study shows (1) the importance of overturn periods (spring or fall) for the annual CH4 and CO2 emissions of northern lakes, (2) the significance of lakes as atmospheric carbon sources in subarctic landscapes while fens can be a strong carbon sink, and (3) the potential for ecosystem-scale eddy covariance measurements to improve the understanding of short-term processes driving lake-atmosphere exchange of CH4 and CO2.",NA,NA,NA,"Parmentier, Frans-Jan/D-9022-2013","Parmentier, Frans-Jan/0000-0003-2952-7706; Friborg, Thomas/0000-0001-5633-6097",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1726-4170,1726-4189,NA,NA,NA,21-Nov,2017,14,22,NA,NA,NA,5189,5216,NA,10.5194/bg-14-5189-2017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000415722100001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We analyzed under-ice DO dynamics based on high-frequency (HF) data at two depths (5 and 25 m) for three winters (January-March 2014, 2015, and 2016) in oligotrophic Lake Tovel (1178 m above sea level; maximum depth 39 m). Specifically, we assessed diel metabolic rates based on HF data of DO, temperature, and light for winter 2016 and seasonal DO depletion rates based on HF data of DO for all three winters. For 2016, calculations of metabolic rates were possible only for 34% and 3% of days at 5 and 25 m, respectively; these metabolic rates generally indicated net heterotrophy at both depths. Low success in modeling metabolic rates was attributed to low diel DO variability and anomalous diel DO patterns, probably linked to under-ice physical processes. Seasonal DO patterns for the three winters showed increasing, decreasing, or stable DO trends at 5 m while at 25 m patterns always showed decreasing DO trends but with different rates. Our multiyear study permitted us to hypothesize that the observed intraannual and interannual differences in DO depletion can be attributed to variable snow cover determining the penetration of radiation and thus photosynthesis. This study brings new insights to DO dynamics in ice-covered systems, highlights the challenges linked to under-ice lake metabolism, and advocates for a modeling approach that includes physical processes. Plain Language Summary More than half of the world's lakes freeze in winter, but scientists still know little about what happens under ice. A major challenge in dealing with winter conditions is the difficulty of sampling when snow and ice often restrict site accessibility. The use of underwater sensors that continuously measure temperature, oxygen, and light has partly overcome this obstacle. However in most lakes, sensors are removed during winter because ice breakup can damage this expensive equipment; Lake Tovel is one of the few lakes where sensors are deployed all year round. Oxygen is needed by organisms for respiration, and how much oxygen is still available in the lake when ice melts will have important implications for the rest of the year. We analyzed 3 years of under-ice oxygen data and show that oxygen can increase at 5 m depth but always decreased at 25 m depth. Climate change predictions indicate less snow in the Alps and earlier ice breakup. We show how water movement and snow influence under-ice oxygen. Our study brings new insights to oxygen dynamics in ice-covered systems and highlights the challenges in understanding the biological and physical factors that influence oxygen in ice-covered lakes.","[Obertegger, Ulrike; Flaim, Giovanna] Fdn Edmund Mach, Res & Innovat Ctr, San Michele All Adige, Trentino, Italy; [Obrador, Biel] Univ Barcelona, Dept Evolutionary Biol Ecol & Environm Sci, Barcelona, Spain","Obertegger, U; Flaim, G (reprint author), Fdn Edmund Mach, Res & Innovat Ctr, San Michele All Adige, Trentino, Italy.",ulrike.obertegger@fmach.it; giovanna.flaim@fmach.it,"Obrador, Biel/A-1856-2009; Obertegger, Ulrike/A-8254-2010","Obrador, Biel/0000-0003-4050-0491; Obertegger, Ulrike/0000-0002-4057-9366; Flaim, Giovanna/0000-0002-1753-5605",FEM; NETLAKE COST Action [ES120]; COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology),"This work was supported by FEM and a grant to UO from the NETLAKE COST Action ES120, supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology).

The dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC, respectively) concentrations were 15-30 mg l(-1) and 0.5.9 mg l(-1) in the humic lake and 0.8-4.3 mg l(-1) and 18-52 mg l(-1) in the organic-poor lake, respectively. The DOC profile in the organic-poor lake was sensitive to phytoplankton blooms in July-August and snowmelt in May, whereas the organic-rich lake was a highly stable system throughout the year in both the epilimnion and hypolimnion, with significant (ca. 40%) increase in DOC concentration in the hypolimnion relative to the epilimnion. The ratio of dissolved organic carbon to organic nitrogen (C-org/N-org) was significantly lower in the organic-poor lake, reflecting a strong impact of autochthonous N-org production and N diffusion from the sediment to the water column. There was a clear difference in the vertical pattern of the proportion of the low molecular weight (LMW < 1 kDa) organic carbon (OC) between the humic and the organic-poor lakes. Regardless of season, the organic-poor lake's LMW < 1 kDa was 40%-90%, whereas that of the organic-rich lake 20%-30%. This difference was most likely linked to the dominance of peat soil and bog providing allochthonous OC to the organic-rich lake throughout the year, and possible production of LMW autochthonous organic ligands by phytoplankton and photodegradation in the organic-poor lake. The important role of allochthonous organic matter (OM) in the color properties of the lake water was confirmed by the light absorbance in the visual range and specific ultraviolet absorption measurements. Overall, deep humic (organic-rich) lakes are expected to be less sensitive to external impacts and possible climate change. The evaluation of both number and depth of humic lakes in the boreal zone is crucial for assessing their CO2 emission and carbon storage potential.","[Chupakov, Artem V.; Chupakova, Anna A.; Moreva, Olga Yu.; Shirokova, Liudmila S.; Zabelina, Svetlana A.; Vorobieva, Taisia Y.; Klimov, Sergey I.; Brovko, Olga S.] Fed Ctr Integrated Arctic Res, Inst Ecol Problems North, Naberezhnaya Severnoi Dviny 23, RU-163000 Arkhangelsk, Russia; [Shirokova, Liudmila S.; Pokrovsky, Oleg S.] Univ Toulouse, GET UMR CNRS 5563, Observ Midi Pyrenees, 14 Ave Edouard Belin, FR-31400 Toulouse, France; [Pokrovsky, Oleg S.] Tomsk State Univ, BIOGEO CLIM Lab, Lenin Ave 36, RU-634050 Tomsk, Russia","Pokrovsky, OS (reprint author), Univ Toulouse, GET UMR CNRS 5563, Observ Midi Pyrenees, 14 Ave Edouard Belin, FR-31400 Toulouse, France.; Pokrovsky, OS (reprint author), Tomsk State Univ, BIOGEO CLIM Lab, Lenin Ave 36, RU-634050 Tomsk, Russia.",oleg.pokrovsky@get.omp.eu,"Zabelina, Svetlana/A-8851-2014",NA,"RSF [15-17-10009]; RFFI [16-35-00330_mol_a, 14-5-NP-115]; FASO Russia [0410-2014-0030]; program of the RAS [0410-2015-0027]; BIO-GEO-CLIM grant of the Russian Ministry of Science and Education [14.B25.31.0001]","We acknowledge support from a RSF grant no. 15-17-10009 awarded to LS (50%), grants RFFI nos. 16-35-00330_mol_a and 14-5-NP-115, FASO Russia (theme no. 0410-2014-0030) and the program of the RAS no. 0410-2015-0027.

However, measurements are rare. We estimated the terrestrial load of DOC, DIC, and methane (CH4) to a small boreal lake for the open water period, on the basis of measured concentrations of carbon species in near-shore groundwater wells and inlet streams, and measured area-specific discharge. The subcatchment directly draining into the lake via groundwater seepage contributed 18% to the total water input during the open water season. Compared to stream and lake water, near-shore groundwater concentrations of DOC were slightly elevated, and groundwater DIC and CH4 concentrations were highly elevated. Consequently, direct groundwater seepage contributed 27% to the total DOC load, 64% to the total DIC load, and 96% to the total CH4 load from the catchment to the lake. Groundwater DIC import corresponded only to 5-8% of lake carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. In incubation experiments, we observed higher photochemical DOC loss rates in stream and groundwater samples (18-55% DOC loss upon 72h UV-A exposure) than in lake water (15% DOC loss) and detected significant DOC flocculation in groundwater samples in both light and dark incubations (2-24% DOC loss). We conclude that even in regions where lake hydrology is dominated by surface water inflow via inlet streams, direct groundwater seepage can represent an important carbon source to boreal lakes, and groundwater DOC may be susceptible to in-lake removal via degradation and flocculation.","[Einarsdottir, Karolina; Wallin, Marcus B.; Sobek, Sebastian] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet Limnol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Wallin, Marcus B.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Uppsala, Sweden","Einarsdottir, K (reprint author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet Limnol, Uppsala, Sweden.",karolina.einarsdottir@ebc.uu.se,NA,NA,Swedish Research Council for Environment (Formas); Swedish Research Council (VR); King Carl XVI Gustafs award for environmental science; European Research Council under the European Union/ERC [336642]; NordForsk through the DOMQUA project,"The authors would like to thank Anastasija Isidorova, Jan Johansson, Jovana Kokic, and Juliane Krenz for assisting in the field and with laboratory work.

Organic carbon (OC) burial and mineralization in the sediments were quantified from Pb-210-dated sediment and laboratory sediment incubation experiments, respectively. Burial and mineralization rates were then upscaled to the entire basin and to one whole year using sediment thickness derived from sub-bottom profiling, basin morphometry, and water column monitoring data of temperature and oxygen concentration. Furthermore, catchment C import, open water metabolism, photochemical mineralization as well as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions to the atmosphere were quantified to relate sediment processes to other lake C fluxes. We found that on a whole-basin and annual scale, sediment OC mineralization was three times larger than OC burial, and contributed about 16% to the annual CO2 emission. Other contributions to CO2 emission were water column metabolism (31%), photochemical mineralization (6%), and catchment imports via inlet streams and inflow of shallow groundwater (22%). The remainder (25%) could not be explained by our flux calculations, but was most likely attributed to an underestimation in groundwater inflow. We conclude that on an annual and whole-basin scale (1) sediment OC mineralization dominated over OC burial, (2) water column OC mineralization contributed more to lake CO2 emission than sediment OC mineralization, and (3) catchment import of C to the lake was greater than lake-internal C cycling.","[Chmiel, Hannah E.; Kokic, Jovana; Denfeld, Blaize A.; Einarsdottir, Karolina; Wallin, Marcus B.; Koehler, Birgit; Isidorova, Anastasija; Sobek, Sebastian] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet Limnol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Wallin, Marcus B.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Uppsala, Sweden; [Bastviken, David] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, Linkoping, Sweden; [Ferland, Marie-Eve] Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Biol, Grp Rech Interuniv Limnol, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Chmiel, HE (reprint author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet Limnol, Uppsala, Sweden.",hannah.elisa.chmiel@gmail.com,NA,NA,European Research Council (ERC); Swedish research council FORMAS; Swedish Research Council; King Carl XVI Gustavs award for environmental science,"We want to thank Elias Broman, Tom Liffen, and Jan Johansson for assistance in the laboratory and in the field, and Roger A.

Current knowledge on the regional control and variability of below ice partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) is lacking, creating a gap in our understanding of how ice cover dynamics affect the CO2 accumulation below ice and therefore CO2 emissions from inland waters during the ice-melt period. To narrow this gap, we identified the drivers of below ice pCO(2) variation across 506 Swedish and Finnish lakes using water chemistry, lake morphometry, catchment characteristics, lake position, and climate variables. We found that lake depth and trophic status were the most important variables explaining variations in below ice pCO(2) across the 506 lakes(.) Together, lake morphometry and water chemistry explained 53% of the site-to-site variation in below ice pCO(2). Regional climate (including ice cover duration) and latitude only explained 7% of the variation in below ice pCO(2). Thus, our results suggest that on a regional scale a shortening of the ice cover period on lakes may not directly affect the accumulation of CO2 below ice but rather indirectly through increased mobility of nutrients and carbon loading to lakes. Thus, given that climate-induced changes are most evident in northern ecosystems, adequately predicting the consequences of a changing climate on future CO2 emission estimates from northern lakes involves monitoring changes not only to ice cover but also to changes in the trophic status of lakes.","[Denfeld, Blaize A.; Sobek, Sebastian; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa A.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet Limnol, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Norbyvagen 18D, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Kortelainen, Pirkko] Finnish Environm Inst, POB 140, Helsinki 00251, Finland; [Rantakari, Miitta] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, Viikinkaari 9, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Rantakari, Miitta] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, Gustaf Hallstromin Katu 2a, Helsinki 00560, Finland","Denfeld, BA (reprint author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet Limnol, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Norbyvagen 18D, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",Blaize.Denfeld@ebc.uu.se,NA,"Rantakari, Miitta Maria/0000-0003-2335-6192","NordForsk; Swedish Research Council (VR); Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS); NordForsk (DOMQUA); Norwegian Research Council (Norklima ECCO); US National Science Foundation (GLEON); European Union (Netlake)","The financial support was received from the NordForsk approved Nordic Centre of Excellence CRAICC, the Swedish Research Council (VR), and the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS).

We examine each feature descriptor by considering one classification method, such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method, with three unique facial expression recognition (FER) datasets. In addition to test accuracies, we present confusion matrices of AFER. We also analyze the effect of using these feature and image resolutions on AFER performance.

Screening mammograms include images of both breasts using two standard views, and the contralateral asymmetry per view is a key feature in detecting breast cancer. However, most automated detection algorithms do not take it into account. In this research, we propose a methodology to incorporate said asymmetry information into a computer-aided diagnosis system that can accurately discern between healthy subjects and subjects at risk of having breast cancer. Furthermore, we generate features that measure not only a view-wise asymmetry, but a subject-wise one. Briefly, the methodology co-registers the left and right mammograms, extracts image characteristics, fuses them into subject-wise features, and classifies subjects. In this study, 152 subjects from two independent databases, one with analog-and one with digital mammograms, were used to validate the methodology. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.738 and 0.767, and diagnostic odds ratios of 23.10 and 9.00 were achieved, respectively. In addition, the proposed method has the potential to rank subjects by their probability of having breast cancer, aiding in the re-scheduling of the radiologists' image queue, an issue of utmost importance in developing countries.

Our study determined that CAD research has been classified and categorized according to disease type and imaging modality. This classification began with the CAD of mammograms and eventually progressed to that of brain disease. Furthermore, based on our results, we discuss future directions and opportunities for CAD research. First, in contrast to the typical hypothetical approach, the data-driven approach has shown promise. Second, the normalization of the test datasets and an evaluation method is necessary when adopting an algorithm and a system. Third, we discuss opportunities for the co-evolution of CAD research and imaging instruments-for example, the CAD of bones and pancreatic cancer.

Early detection and treatment of breast cancer could decline the mortality rate. Some issues such as technical reasons, which related to imaging quality and human error, increase misdiagnosis of breast cancer by radiologists. Computer-aided detection systems (CADs) are developed to overcome these restrictions and have been studied in many imaging modalities for breast cancer detection in recent years. The CAD systems improve radiologists' performance in finding and discriminating between the normal and abnormal tissues. These procedures are performed only as a double reader but the absolute decisions are still made by the radiologist. In this study, the recent CAD systems for breast cancer detection on different modalities such as mammography, ultrasound, MRI, and biopsy histopathological images are introduced. The foundation of CAD systems generally consist of four stages: Pre-processing, Segmentation, Feature extraction, and Classification. The approaches which applied to design different stages of CAD system are summarised. Advantages and disadvantages of different segmentation, feature extraction and classification techniques are listed. In addition, the impact of imbalanced datasets in classification outcomes and appropriate methods to solve these issues are discussed.

If all constructs are modeled as common factors, OrdPLSc yields estimates close to those of its covariance-based counterpart, WLSMV, but is less efficient. If some constructs are modeled as composites, OrdPLSc is virtually without competition.","[Schuberth, Florian] Univ Wurzburg, Fac Business Management & Econ, Sanderring 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Henseler, Jorg] Univ Twente, Fac Engn Technol, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Dijkstra, Theo K.] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Nettelbosje 2,POB 800, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands","Henseler, J (reprint author), Univ Twente, Fac Engn Technol, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",florian.schuberth@uni-wuerzburg.de; j.henseler@utwente.nl; t.k.dijkstra@rug.nl,NA,"Schuberth, Florian/0000-0002-2110-9086; Henseler, Jorg/0000-0002-9736-3048",NA,NA,75,1,1,2,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0033-5177,1573-7845,NA,QUAL QUANT,Qual.

As with spherical particles, clogging may occur due to the formation of arches of particles around the orifice. The clogging probability decreases with increasing orifice width in both cases. For a given width, however, the clogging probability is much higher for the nonspherical particles due to their arbitrary orientations and the possibility of geometrical interlocking. We also examine the effect of placing a fixed, circular obstacle above the orifice. The clogging probability depends strongly on the vertical and lateral position of the obstacle, as well as its size. By suitably placing the obstacle the clogging probability can be significantly reduced compared to a system with no obstacle. We attempt to elucidate the clogging reduction mechanism by examining the packing fraction, granular temperature, and velocity distributions of the particles in the vicinity of the orifice.","[Reddy, A.

Evacuees' decisions in such circumstances could be better made with an awareness of fire dynamics and potential risks. Rationality is a human factor which has an essential role in accomplishing typical evacuation in emergency situations. In this article, the authors propose a rule-based exit choice model in which the simulated individuals are provided with the assessment of exit's disutility and decision-making capability for selecting and reselecting exits due to the evacuation dynamics. The model allows for the simulation of systematic crowd distribution at exits up until the end of the evacuation process, thereby accomplishing a more efficient evacuation. For further refinement, we allow the individuals to predict the dynamics of the fire spreading and involve its effect on the individuals' assessment. We consider a precaution time for each individual as an essential parameter to guarantee safety from the fire spreading or equivalent risk.

Although it is difficult to measure panics in real conditions, we introduced a simple model to study the collective behaviors in condition of fire with dense smoke. Owing to blocking the sight with dense smoke, pedestrians in this condition have two strategies to escape: random-walking or walking along the wall. When the pedestrians are in moderate panic that mean the two types of behaviors are mixed(random-walking and walking along the wall). Our simulation results show that moderate panic, meaning that two escape strategies are mixed, reduces the escape time. In addition, the results indicate that moderate panic can improve the efficiency of escape, this theory also can be useful in a real escape situation. We hope that our research provides the theoretical understanding of underlying mechanisms of panic escape in the condition of poor sight. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this research, a crowd evacuation passing through a narrow exit connected with guide-walls is analysed using the discrete element method based on physical and psychological modelling in parallel with empirical rodent research. Results of rodent experiment and simulation demonstrate the faster-is-slower (FIS) effect, which is a well-known phenomenon in pedestrian dynamics. As the angle of the guide-walls increases, agents rapidly evacuate the room even though they have low velocity. The increase in this angle causes agents to form lanes. It is validated that ordered agents evacuate expeditiously with relatively low velocity despite expectations to the contrary. The extracted experimental and simulation data strongly suggest that the agents' standard deviation of velocity can be a key factor causing the FIS effect. It is found that the FIS effect can be eliminated by controlling the standard deviation.","[Oh, Hyejin] Kumoh Natl Inst Technol, Grad Sch, Dept Mech Design Engn, 61 Daehak Ro, Gumi, South Korea; [Park, Junyoung] Kumoh Natl Inst Technol, Dept Mech Design Engn, 61 Daehak Ro, Gumi, South Korea","Oh, H (reprint author), Kumoh Natl Inst Technol, Grad Sch, Dept Mech Design Engn, 61 Daehak Ro, Gumi, South Korea.; Park, J (reprint author), Kumoh Natl Inst Technol, Dept Mech Design Engn, 61 Daehak Ro, Gumi, South Korea.",hjoh8615@gmail.com; pcello@kumoh.ac.kr,NA,NA,"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [NRF-2015R1D1A3A01019530]; MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program [IITP-2017-2014-0-00639]","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [NRF-2015R1D1A3A01019530] and the MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program (IITP-2017-2014-0-00639) supervised by the IITP (Institute for Information & Communications Technology Promotion).

We refine the model to endow the individuals with the ability to leave their exits due to dynamic changes by modifying the model of their excitement resulted from the source of panic. This facilitates the approximately equal crowd size at exits for being until the end of the evacuation process, and thereby the model accomplishes more optimal evacuation.

The simulation results are meaningful for the officials to control the information propagation in metro emergency.","[Zhao Hai-feng; Sun Yan-qiu] Tongji Univ, Sch Management & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Zhao, HF (reprint author), Tongji Univ, Sch Management & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",NA,NA,NA,"NSFC [71272045, 71101107]","This research was supported by the NSFC general program (Grant No. 71272045,71101107).",8,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2161-1890,NA,NA,I C SERV SYST SERV M,NA,NA,2017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Operations Research & Management Science",Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science,BJ7DO,WOS:000427112300007,NA,NA,NA,NA,9/30/2018

Intuition leads to more obvious preferences on escape judgment and decision-making than does deliberation under unconscious priming condition. People are more cautious with decision making than judgment across two experiments. Priming method was adopted because the same primes tend to activate different associative links for different people (Cameron et al., 2012). Across two experiments, reliable and consistent evidence shows that when facing a crisis (e.g., fire), searching for an exit and avoiding smoke are preferred by people rather than following the crowd. In Experiment 1, we demonstrated that searching for an exit and avoiding smoke were judged as more helpful than following the crowd by both intuition and deliberation regardless whether the situation is simple or complex. In Experiment 2, we found that intuition has a more significant influence on judgment and decision making than deliberation under both simple and complex situations. Our findings contribute to the crisis literature by demonstrating that people less prefer to follow the crowd when escaping from crisis situations, and that intuition is more effective under unconscious priming condition.

This feature of human movement and other bipeds is largely ignored in simulation models of pedestrians and crowds. We present a concise movement model for pedestrians based on stepwise movement. A series of controlled experiments was conducted to calibrate the model based on individual behaviour of pedestrians. We find that a change of direction is constrained by the current walking speed: the higher the speed the smaller the possible change of direction. Additionally, we present the trajectories and distances subjects held to a wall when walking around a corner. We use this result as a parameter for the simulation model. Finally, we validate the model's behaviour with an egress scenario with a corridor as bottleneck. The resulting trajectories show behaviour that has been found in controlled experiments with similar set-ups: if there is enough space, individuals try to walk in the middle of the corridor, but when a congestion is present multiple lanes form allowing for higher pedestrian flow. The model separates the behavioural aspects from biomechanical movement thus facilitating expandability and allowing experts to focus on their respective fields of expertise. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The trample behavior characteristics are generated from computer simulation. This paper uses a heuristic clustering model based on self-organizing mapping (SOM) to map the scenarios characteristics into conditional attributes, and map trample behavior characteristics into decision attributes, respectively. Then both of the mapped conditional attributes and decision attributes are discretized. Further a novel knowledge discovery model based on rough set theory is proposed.

In crowd evacuation processes, preserving normal crowd density at an exit is crucial. Here, we introduce a new mechanism for the reproduction of specific flow rate within the range stated in the literature. For the implementation of this mechanism into the social force model, an association between the pedestrians' social responsibility to relieve any unusual crowd density in front of an exit and a reduction in their competition behavior is presented, where the pedestrians' perception of what is behind them is the main factor in this association. Accordingly, a model is proposed for rear perception subject to the production of the fundamental diagram and the specific flow rate, while conserving the interpedestrian dynamics by which the social force model is characterized. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the validity of this mechanism.","Al Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ IMSIU, Coll Sharia & Islamic Studies Al Ahsaa, Dept Comp Sci, Al Ahsaa 31982, Saudi Arabia","Shuaib, MM (reprint author), Al Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ IMSIU, Coll Sharia & Islamic Studies Al Ahsaa, Dept Comp Sci, Al Ahsaa 31982, Saudi Arabia.",mh_shuaib@yahoo.com,NA,NA,NA,NA,53,5,5,1,12,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-5468,NA,NA,J STAT MECH-THEORY E,J.

Since the introduction of this requirement, there is however growing concern over the prolonged standing of spectators in seated areas as seated accommodation are not designated for standing and could thus poses risk to the safety of spectators. This study therefore investigated how spectator standing in seated accommodation affects the safety of spectators, and why spectators stand in seated accommodation by the use of semi-structured interviews. The interview participants included football club safety managers, a safety officer responsible for issuing safety licences at designated grounds and a spectator. The study indicates that the safety risk posed by spectator standing in seated areas include a spectator falling over a seat or guard rail and the obstruction of access for emergency services. The study further indicates that spectator standing is influenced by factors such as the fixture of the game, moments of excitement, spectator comfort, and the atmosphere of the crowd. The findings of the study provide valuable insight to stimulate proactive thinking towards implementing measures in relation to football stadia design and management to ensure safety.

The latter incorporation has enhanced the ability of the model to represent the decision-making process of pedestrians. However, the variety of pedestrian's abilities to make decisions in emergency situations has not been incorporated properly into the model.

Some major problems are congestion, emergency evacuation, and fatal catastrophe. In fact, it has been realized that many crowd related problems can be resolved by influencing (controlling) human flow with providing various control measures. Thus, the problem itself becomes the motivation for this research and the solution is approached through model and simulation within the virtual environment. The relationship between fractal pattern and crowd behavior is produced with respect to the crowd behavior model. It exposes a comparison between the crowd paths resulting from the model developed and the fractal formation created to imitate the crowd paths. A new approach for crowd behavior modeling is proposed based on fractal features and, thus, gives new understanding about a relationship between fractal pattern and crowd behavior. Several innovations of fractal patterns that can be used in crowd behavior model applications adds to the novelty of the research contribution. Ultimately, the new method of modeling the crowd can be obtained and at the same time the new direction of crowd modeling research can be directed.","[Widyarto, Setyawan] State Polytech Lampung, Dept Comp & Informat Management, Bandar Lampung 35145, Indonesia; [Widyarto, Setyawan] Fac Ind Informat Technol, Selangor 45600, Darul Ehsan, Malaysia; [Latiff, M.

Each person is represented by three overlapping circles with a position, orientation and velocity in 2D. Contact forces between elements are modelled as well as psychological forces and motive forces and moments. Motion is then modelled in a Newtonian manner with a numerical integration time-stepping scheme. The model is tested on a single enclosure entry scenario where some model parameters are scaled. Motion is generally realistic, although areas for improvement are identified. Flow and contact forces are monitored under different scenarios. The model is then used on a multi-enclosure entry scenario. It is shown that stewarding significantly reduces contact forces and hence risk of injury. The potential for further applications is demonstrated on hypothetical scenarios on the London Underground. It is concluded that the model is reasonably realistic for dense crowd flow scenarios, but more complex situations like a supermarket would require aspects of Artificial Intelligence in the model, which is a feasible development.

Our evaluations of video recordings show that the geometric boundary conditions are not only relevant for the capacity of the elements of pedestrian facilities, they also influence the time gap distribution of pedestrians, indicating the existence of self-organization phenomena. After calibration of suitable models, these findings can be used to improve design elements of pedestrian facilities and egress routes. It turns out that obstacles can stabilize flow patterns and make them more fluid. Moreover, intersecting flows can be optimized, utilizing the phenomenon of stripe formation. We also suggest increasing diameters of egress routes in stadia, theaters, and lecture halls to avoid long waiting times for people in the back, and shock waves due to impatience in cases of emergency evacuation. Moreover, zigzag-shaped geometries and columns can reduce the pressure in panicking crowds. The proposed design solutions are expected to increase the efficiency and safety of train stations, airport terminals, stadia, theaters, public buildings, and mass events in the future.

Some of the questions now understood are the following: Why are vehicles sometimes stopped by phantom traffic jams even though drivers all like to drive fast? What are the mechanisms behind stop-and-go traffic? Why are there several different kinds of congestion, and how are they related? Why do most traffic jams occur considerably before the road capacity is reached? Can a temporary reduction in the volume of traffic cause a lasting traffic jam? Under which conditions can speed limits speed up traffic? Why do pedestrians moving in opposite directions normally organize into lanes, while similar systems freeze by heating? All of these questions have been answered by applying and extending methods from statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics to self-driven many-particle systems. This article considers the empirical data and then reviews the main approaches to modeling pedestrian and vehicle traffic. These include microscopic (particle-based), mesoscopic (gas-kinetic), and macroscopic (fluid-dynamic) models. Attention is also paid to the formulation of a micro-macro link, to aspects of universality, and to other unifying concepts, such as a general modeling framework for self-driven many-particle systems, including spin systems. While the primary focus is upon vehicle and pedestrian traffic, applications to biological or socio-economic systems such as bacterial colonies, flocks of birds, panics, and stock market dynamics are touched upon as well.","Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Econ & Traff, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; Univ Stuttgart, Inst Theoret Phys, D-70550 Stuttgart, Germany; Coll Budapest, Inst Adv Study, H-1014 Budapest, Hungary","Helbing, D (reprint author), Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Econ & Traff, Andreas Schubert Str 23, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.",helbing@trafficforum.org,"Helbing, Dirk/C-6114-2008",NA,NA,NA,821,1918,1972,27,433,AMER PHYSICAL SOC,COLLEGE PK,"ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA",0034-6861,1539-0756,NA,REV MOD PHYS,Rev.

Sometimes this behaviour is triggered in life-threatening situations such as fires in crowded buildings(1,2); at other times, stampedes can arise during the rush for seats(3,4) or seemingly without cause. Although engineers are finding ways to alleviate the scale of such disasters, their frequency seems to be increasing with the number and size of mass events(2,5). But systematic studies of panic behaviour(6-9) and quantitative theories capable of predicting such crowd dynamics(5,10-12) are rare. Here we use a model of pedestrian behaviour to investigate the mechanisms of (and preconditions for) panic and jamming by uncoordinated motion in crowds. Our simulations suggest practical ways to prevent dangerous crowd pressures. Moreover, we rnd an optimal strategy for escape from a smoke-filled room, involving a mixture of individualistic behaviour and collective `herding' instinct.","Collegium Budapest, Inst Adv Study, H-1014 Budapest, Hungary; Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Econ & Traff, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Biol Phys, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary","Helbing, D (reprint author), Collegium Budapest, Inst Adv Study, Szentharomsag 2, H-1014 Budapest, Hungary.",helbing@trafficforum.de,"Helbing, Dirk/C-6114-2008; Aschwanden, Gideon/A-8556-2010; Farkas, Illes/C-1504-2008; Vicsek, Tamas/A-3305-2009","Farkas, Illes/0000-0001-5341-5582; ",NA,NA,20,1892,2093,37,405,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,NA,NA,NATURE,Nature,28-Sep,2000,407,6803,NA,NA,NA,487,490,NA,10.1038/35035023,NA,NA,NA,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,361MT,WOS:000089727400042,11028994,NA,NA,NA,9/30/2018

This was based on the collected data that include climate properties, type of dangerous materials, topography, and type of release. The developed model was embedded in a GIS environment to generate impact zones based on both the dispersion model and the emergency response guide recommendations.

Cloud computing is already changing the way IT services are provided by so called cloud companies and how businesses and users interact with IT resources. Big Data is a data analysis methodology enables by recent advances in information and communications technology. However, big data analysis requires a huge amount of computing resources making adoption costs of big data technology is not affordable for many small to medium enterprises. In this paper, we outline the the benefits and challenges involved in deploying big data analytics through cloud computing. We argue that cloud computing can support the storage and computing requirements of big data analytics. We discuss how the consolidation of these two dominant technologies can enhance the process of big data mining enabling businesses to improve decision-making processes. We also highlight the issues and risks that should be addressed when using a so called CLaaS, cloud-based service model. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Landsat ETM and SPOT data were used for this purpose. By combining the temperature and vegetation index models (TVX), the effects of urban green space reduction on the thermal environment during city development were evaluated. The results show the following. (1) During 1999-2013, 88.1 km(2) of urban green space was converted to other land uses, accounting for a 29.4% reduction in urban green space in the study area. (2) During the study period, the LST in this area increased by +8.455 K. The evolution of the regional thermal landscape can be characterized by increases in the LST, greater complexity of the thermal landscape structure, increase and aggregation of high-temperature areas, and reduction and fragmentation of low-temperature areas. (3) During the process of urbanization, urban green space with low land-surface temperature was converted to other land use types with high land-surface temperature. When development occurred at the price of urban green space, negative effects on the regional thermal environment were observed. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

In order to address some of these challenges, developers have leveraged virtualization containers toward seamless deployment of preconfigured bioinformatics software and pipelines on any computational platform. We present an approach for abstracting the complex data operations of multistep, bioinformatics pipelines for NGS data analysis. As examples, we have deployed 2 pipelines for RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, preconfigured within Docker virtualization containers we call Bio-Docklets. Each Bio-Docklet exposes a single data input and output endpoint and from a user perspective, running the pipelines as simply as running a single bioinformatics tool. This is achieved using a meta-script that automatically starts the Bio-Docklets and controls the pipeline execution through the BioBlend software library and the Galaxy Application Programming Interface. The pipeline output is postprocessed by integration with the Visual Omics Explorer framework, providing interactive data visualizations that users can access through a web browser. Our goal is to enable easy access to NGS data analysis pipelines for nonbioinformatics experts on any computing environment, whether a laboratory workstation, university computer cluster, or a cloud service provider.

In this study, the brain is conceived to be embedded in a holographic structured field that interacts with resonant sensitive structures in the various cell types in our body. In order to explain earlier reported ultra-rapid brain responses and effective operation of the meta-stable neural system, a field-receptive mental workspace is proposed to be communicating with the brain. Our integral nervous system is seen as a dedicated neural transmission and multi-cavity network that, in a non-dual manner, interacts with the proposed supervening meta-cognitive domain. Among others, it is integrating discrete patterns of eigen-frequencies of photonic/solitonic waves, thereby continuously updating a time-symmetric global memory space of the individual. Its toroidal organization allows the coupling of gravitational, dark energy, zero-point energy field (ZPE) as well as earth magnetic fields energies and transmits wave information into brain tissue, that thereby is instrumental in high speed conscious and sub-conscious information processing. We propose that the supposed field-receptive workspace, in a mutual interaction with the whole nervous system, generates self-consciousness and is conceived as operating from a 4th spatial dimension (hyper-sphere). Its functional structure is adequately defined by the geometry of the torus, that is envisioned as a basic unit (operator) of space-time. The latter is instrumental in collecting the pattern of discrete soliton frequencies that provided an algorithm for coherent life processes, as earlier identified by us. It is postulated that consciousness in the entire universe arises through, scale invariant, nested toroidal coupling of various energy fields, that may include quantum error correction. In the brain of the human species, this takes the form of the proposed holographic workspace, that collects active information in a brain event horizon, representing an internal and fully integral model of the self. This brain-supervening workspace is equipped to convert integrated coherent wave energies into attractor type/standing waves that guide the related cortical template to a higher coordination of reflection and action as well as network synchronicity, as required for conscious states. In relation to its scale-invariant global character, we find support for a universal information matrix, that was extensively described earlier, as a supposed implicate order as well as in a spectrum of space-time theories in current physics. The presence of a field-receptive resonant workspace, associated with, but not reducible to, our brain, may provide an interpretation framework for widely reported, but poorly understood transpersonal conscious states and algorithmic origin of life. It also points out the deep connection of mankind with the cosmos and our major responsibility for the future of our planet.","[Meijer, Dirk K.

For example, wearable medical aid devices are designed to provide long-term assistance to patients with temporary or permanent disabilities. Patients can constantly monitor several vital signs such as ECG (Electrocardiography), respiration, skin temperature, pulse, blood pressure, body kinematics, etc. Medical aid can be immediately provided when any sign is abnormal and save a life.

A series of solutions were prepared, with varying both APG/FA ratio and its concentration in water. Different structures were then obtained, depending on these two parameters: aqueous micellar solutions, normal hexagonal liquid crystalline phase, a-gel phase, as well as the mixture of normal hexagonal/alpha-gel phases. A specific term auto-emulsion was introduced to describe the pseudo emulsions formed by the APG <= FA containing solutions because of the fatty alcohol, which dispersion in water was similar to an emulsion representation. The presence of the liquid crystals was revealed by optical microscopy under the polarized light, as different anisotropic conformations corresponding to the lamellar phase, the hexagonal phase and the coexistence of the lamellar and hexagonal phases, mainly for the most concentrated samples, were observed. These structures were characterized at the molecular level through the wide-angle X-ray diffraction technique and their macroscopic behaviour was investigated by rheology tests. Two main observations were then made: the variation of the surfactant concentration in solution promotes the transition between micellar region towards the liquid crystalline formation zone, while the APG/FA ratio impacts the formation of hexagonal phases (APG > FA) or of lamellar ones (APG < FA).

Dewhiskering may lead to an alteration in the thalamocortical connectivity and relevant behavioral functions. Since C57BL/6J is a commonly used strain for neurobehavioral studies, it is important to examine how whisker dependent heterogeneity affects the internal validity of behavioral phenotypes. The present study aimed to investigate the responsiveness of mice to different behavioral test paradigms in the presence or absence of whiskers. We employed two models of whisker deprivation: Acute Whisker Desensitization (AWD) and Chronic Habitual Dewhiskering (CHD). The AWD model blocks whisker sensation by lidocaine application. For CHD model, mice at the age of 12 weeks were carefully scrutinized for presence or absence of whiskers and divided into three groups, the whiskered mice, partially dewhiskered mice and completely dewhiskered mice. The whisker-dependent behavioral functions were assessed using open field test, novel object recognition test, marble burying test and forced swim test. Our results showed that habitual dewhiskering significantly altered the short-term memory and basal anxiety-like functions. Such behavioral alteration due to dewhiskering was significantly different in fully and partially dewhiskered mice, which is indicative of behavioral adaptation to the whisker desensitization. Contrary to CHD, the Acute Whisker Desensitization ameliorated behavioral compulsivity and basal anxiety. Our results suggest that vibrissal desensitization in the mice may lead to changes in their affective and cognitive state. Since, heterogeneity in whisker status may affect behavioral functions, careful inspection of the whisker status of C57BL/6J mice is recommended to increase the reproducibility and reliability of results obtained from behavioral assessments.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0166-4328,1872-7549,NA,NA,NA,15-Jan,2018,336,NA,NA,NA,NA,51,58,NA,10.1016/j.bbr.2017.08.004,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000413382100008,28822693,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, recent studies have shown involvement of the left putamen in other language functions such as bilingual language processing (Abutalebi et al. 2012) and production, with some authors arguing for functional segregation of anterior and posterior putamen (Oberhuber et al. 2013). A further step in exploring the role of putamen in language would involve identifying the network of coactivations of not only the left, but also the right putamen, given the involvement of right hemisphere in high order language functions (Vigneau et al. 2011). Here, a meta-analytic connectivity modeling technique was used to determine the patterns of coactivation of anterior and bilateral putamen in the language domain. Based on previous evidence, we hypothesized that left putamen coactivations would include brain regions directly associated with language processing, whereas right putamen coactivations would encompass regions involved in broader semantic processes, such as memory and visual imagery. The results showed that left anterior putamen coactivated with clusters predominantly in left hemisphere, encompassing regions directly associated with language processing, a left posterior putamen network spanning both hemispheres, and cerebellum. In right hemisphere, coactivations were in both hemispheres, in regions associated with visual and orthographic processing. These results confirm the differential involvement of right and left putamen in different language components, thus highlighting the need for further research into the role of putamen in language.","[Vias-Guasch, Nestor] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ & Human Dev, Ctr Brain & Educ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yan Jing] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Psychol & Sociol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","Vias-Guasch, N (reprint author), Educ Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ & Human Dev, Ctr Brain & Educ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",nestroy@msn.com,NA,"Vinas-Guasch, Nestor/0000-0002-8661-0103",Central Reserve Fund (The Education University of Hong Kong) [Central Reserve Fund (The Education University of Hong Kong: 03A21]; Area of Strength (The Faculty of Education and Human Development) [04094],The present work is supported by the Central Reserve Fund (The Education University of Hong Kong: 03A21) and the Area of Strength (The Faculty of Education and Human Development: 04094).,101,2,2,3,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2653,1863-2661,NA,BRAIN STRUCT FUNCT,Brain Struct.

Over two decades of neuroimaging research reveals clear anatomical and physiological differences in the speech neural networks of adults who stutter. However, there have been few neurophysiological investigations of speech production in children who stutter. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we examined hemodynamic responses over neural regions integral to fluent speech production including inferior frontal gyrus, premotor cortex, and superior temporal gyrus during a picture description task. Thirty-two children (16 stuttering and 16 controls) aged 7-11 years participated in the study. We found distinctly different speech-related hemodynamic responses in the group of children who stutter compared to the control group. Whereas controls showed significant activation over left dorsal inferior frontal gyrus and left premotor cortex, children who stutter exhibited deactivation over these left hemisphere regions. This investigation of neural activation during natural, connected speech production in children who stutter demonstrates that in childhood stuttering, atypical functional organization for speech production is present and suggests promise for the use of fNIRS during natural speech production in future research with typical and atypical child populations.","[Walsh, B.; Bostian, A.

However, the brain regions implementing these components are still controversial and have not been clarified via a comprehensive lesion model encompassing the whole range of language-related cortices. Primary progressive aphasia (PPA), for which anomia is thought to be the most common sign, provides such a model, but the exploration of cortical areas impacting naming in its three main variants and the underlying processing mechanisms is still lacking. Methods We addressed this double issue, related to language structure and PPA, with thirty patients (11 semantic, 12 logopenic, 7 agrammatic variant) using a picture-naming task and voxel-based morphometry for anatomo-functional correlation. First, we analyzed correlations for each of the three variants to identify the regions impacting naming in PPA and to disentangle the core regions of word finding. We then combined the three variants and correlation analyses for naming (semantic-to-lexical mapping) and single-word comprehension (lexical-to-semantic mapping), predicting an overlap zone corresponding to a bidirectional lexical-semantic hub. Results and Conclusions Our results showed that superior portions of the left temporal pole and left posterior temporal cortices impact semantic and lexical naming mechanisms in semantic and logopenic PPA, respectively. In agrammatic PPA naming deficits were rare, and did not correlate with any cortical region. Combined analyses revealed a cortical overlap zone in superior/middle mid-temporal cortices, distinct from the two former regions, impacting bidirectional binding of lexical and semantic information. Altogether, our findings indicate that lexical/semantic word processing depends on an anterior-posterior axis within lateral-temporal cortices, including an anatomically intermediate hub dedicated to lexical-semantic integration. Within this axis our data reveal the underpinnings of anomia in the PPA variants, which is of relevance for both diagnosis and future therapy strategies.","[Migliaccio, Raffaella; Boutet, Claire; Valabregue, Romain; Lehericy, Stephane; Levy, Richard; Dubois, Bruno; Teichmann, Marc] UMR INSERM CNRS UPMC 1127, Inst Cerveau & Moelle Epiniere, Paris, France; [Migliaccio, Raffaella; Ferrieux, Sophie; Nogues, Marie; Dubois, Bruno; Teichmann, Marc] Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, AP HP, Natl Reference Ctr PPA & Rare Dementias, Dept Neurol, Paris, France; [Boutet, Claire; Valabregue, Romain; Lehericy, Stephane] Ctr Neuroimagerie Rech CENIR, Inst Cerveau & Moelle Epiniere, Paris, France; [Dormont, Didier] Univ Paris 06, INSERM, UMR S 678, Paris, France; [Dormont, Didier] Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, AP HP, Serv Neuroradiol Diagnost & Fonct, Paris, France; [Levy, Richard] Hop St Antoine, AP HP, Dept Neurol, F-75571 Paris, France","Teichmann, M (reprint author), UMR INSERM CNRS UPMC 1127, Inst Cerveau & Moelle Epiniere, Paris, France.; Teichmann, M (reprint author), Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, AP HP, Natl Reference Ctr PPA & Rare Dementias, Dept Neurol, Paris, France.",marc.teichmann@psl.aphp.fr,"Levy, Richard/D-8411-2011",NA,France Alzheimer Foundation; Philippe Chatrier Foundation,"We would like to thank Dalila Samri, Tiffany Landure and Richard Gnassounou for assessing patients with general cognitive tests.

Most children with idiopathic CAS have normal structural brain MRI. We hypothesize that children with CAS have altered structural connectivity in speech/language networks compared to controls and that these altered connections are related to functional speech/language measures. Whole brain probabilistic tractography, using constrained spherical deconvolution, was performed for connectome generation in 17 children with CAS and 10 age-matched controls. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was used as a measure of connectivity and the connections with altered FA between CAS and controls were identified. Further, the relationship between altered FA and speech/language scores was determined. Three intra-hemispheric/interhemispheric subnetworks showed reduction of FA in CAS compared to controls, including left inferior (opercular part) and superior (dorsolateral, medial and orbital part) frontal gyrus, left superior and middle temporal gyrus and left post-central gyrus (subnetwork 1); right supplementary motor area, left middle and inferior (orbital part) frontal gyrus, left precuneus and cuneus, right superior occipital gyrus and right cerebellum (subnetwork 2); right angular gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus and right inferior occipital gyrus (subnetwork 3). Reduced FA of some connections correlated with diadochokinesis, oromotor skills, expressive grammar and poor lexical production in CAS. These findings provide evidence of structural connectivity anomalies in children with CAS across specific brain regions involved in speech/language function. We propose altered connectivity as a possible epiphenomenon of complex pathogenic mechanisms in CAS which need further investigation. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Performance on object naming was evaluated alongside three other tests of visual speech production, namely sentence production to a picture, sentence reading and nonword reading. A principal component analysis was performed on all these tests' scores and revealed a 'shared' component that loaded across all the visual speech production tasks and a 'unique' component that isolated object naming from the other three tasks. Regions for the shared component were observed in the left fronto-temporal cortices, fusiform gyrus and bilateral visual cortices. Lesions in these regions linked to both poor object naming and impairment in general visual-speech production. On the other hand, the unique naming component was potentially associated with the bilateral anterior temporal poles, hippocampus and cerebellar areas. This is in line with the models proposing that object naming relies on a left-lateralised language dominant system that interacts with a bilateral anterior temporal network. Neuropsychological deficits in object naming can reflect both the increased demands specific to the task and the more general difficulties in language processing.

Previous studies regarding one's first language (L1) have treated the theory of mind system, which is associated with understanding others, and the sensorimotor system, which is associated with action simulation, as important contributors to communication. However, little is known about the neural basis of communication in a second language (L2), which is limited in terms of its use as a communication tool. In this fMRI study, we manipulated the type of speech (i.e., communication vs. description) and the type of language (L1 vs. L2) to identify the specific brain areas involved in L2 communication. We also attempted to examine how the cortical mechanisms underlying L2 speech production are influenced by oral proficiency and anxiety regarding L2. Thirty native Japanese speakers who had learned English as an 12, performed communicative and descriptive speech-production tasks in both L1 and L2 while undergoing fMRI scanning. We found that the only the L2 communication task recruited the left posterior supramarginal gyrus (pSMG), which may be associated with the action simulation or prediction involved in generating goal-directed actions. Furthermore, the neural mechanisms underlying L2 communication, but not L2 description, were sensitive to both oral proficiency and anxiety levels; (a) activation in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) increased as oral proficiency levels increased, and (b) activation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), including the left insula, decreased as L2 anxiety levels increased. These results reflect the successful retrieval of lexical information in a pragmatic context and an inability to monitor social behaviors due to anxiety. Taken together, the present results suggest that L2 communication relies on social skills and is mediated by anxiety and oral proficiency.

Although it has direct connections to Broca's area, the canonical speech production region, the insula is also broadly connected with other speech and language centres, and may play a role in coordinating higher-order cognitive aspects of speech and language production. The extent of the insula's involvement in speech and language processing was assessed using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method. Meta-analyses of 42 fMRI studies with healthy adults were performed, comparing insula activation during performance of language (expressive and receptive) and speech (production and perception) tasks. Both tasks activated bilateral anterior insulae. However, speech perception tasks preferentially activated the left dorsal mid-insula, whereas expressive language tasks activated left ventral mid-insula. Results suggest distinct regions of the mid-insula play different roles in speech and language processing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Aims: We review research on grammatical deficits in PPA and associated neural mechanisms, with discussion focused on production and comprehension of four aspects of morphosyntactic structure: grammatical morphology, functional categories, verbs and verb argument structure, and complex syntactic structures. We also address assessment of grammatical deficits in PPA, with emphasis on behavioural tests of grammatical processing. Finally, we address research examining the effects of treatment for progressive grammatical impairments. Main Contribution: PPA-G is associated with grammatical deficits that are evident across linguistic domains in both production and comprehension. PPA-G is associated with damage to regions including the left inferior frontal gyrus and dorsal white matter tracts, which have been linked to impaired comprehension and production of complex sentences. Detailing grammatical deficits in PPA is important for estimating the trajectory of language decline and associated neuropathology. We, therefore, highlight several new assessment tools for examining different aspects of morphosyntactic processing in PPA. Conclusions: Individuals with PPA-G present with agrammatic deficit patterns distinct from those associated with PPA-L and PPA-S, but similar to those seen in agrammatism resulting from stroke, and patterns of cortical atrophy and white matter changes associated with PPA-G have been identified. Methods for clinical evaluation of agrammatism, focusing on comprehension and production of grammatical morphology, functional categories, verbs and verb argument structure, and complex syntactic structures are recommended and tools for this are emerging in the literature. Further research is needed to investigate the real-time processes underlying grammatical impairments in PPA, as well as the structural and functional neural correlates of grammatical impairments across linguistic domains. Few studies have examined the effects of treatment for grammatical impairments in PPA; research in this area is needed to better understand how (or if) grammatical processing ability can be improved, the potential for spared neural tissue to be recruited to support this and whether the neural connections within areas of dysfunctional tissue required for grammatical processing can be enhanced using cortical stimulation.","[Thompson, Cynthia K.; Mack, Jennifer E.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Commun Sci & Disorders, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Thompson, Cynthia K.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Cognit Neurol & Alzheimers Dis Ctr, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Thompson, Cynthia K.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA","Thompson, CK (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Commun Sci & Disorders, Francis Searle Bldg,2240 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",ckthom@northwestern.edu,NA,NA,"National Institutes of Health [R01DC01948-20, R01DC008552]","This work was support by the National Institutes of Health [grant numbers R01DC01948-20 and R01DC008552].

It has also been suggested that modulation of the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) might be part of the mechanisms involved in tDCS effects on synaptic connectivity. However, all language studies have previously investigated the effects using unihemispheric stimulation. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the role of bihemispheric tDCS on language recovery and BDNF serum levels. Methods: Seven aphasic persons underwent an intensive language therapy in two different conditions: real bihemispheric stimulation over the left and right Broca's areas and a sham condition. Results: After the stimulation, patients exibited a significant recovery in three language tasks (picture description, noun and verb naming) compared to the sham condition which persisted in the follow-up session. No significant differences were found in BDNF serum levels after tDCS stimulation and in the follow-up session. However, a significant positive correlation was present for the real stimulation condition between percent changes in BDNF levels and in the verb naming task. Conclusions: The data suggest that this novel approach may potentiate the recovery of language in chronic aphasia. They also emphasize the importance to further investigate the role of possible biomarkers associated with tDCS treatment response in language recovery.","[Marangolo, Paola] Univ Politecn Marche, Fac Med, Ancona, Italy; [Marangolo, Paola; Fiori, Valentina; Gelfo, Francesca; Shofany, Jacob; Razzano, Carmelina; Caltagirone, Carlo; Angelucci, Francesco] IRCCS Fdn Santa Lucia, I-00179 Rome, Italy; [Gelfo, Francesca; Caltagirone, Carlo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dipartimento Med Sistemi, Rome, Italy","Marangolo, P (reprint author), Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Expt & Clin Med, Ancona, Italy.",p.marangolo@univpm.it; f.angelucci@hsantalucia.it,NA,"MARANGOLO, Paola/0000-0002-1516-9832; fiori, valentina/0000-0002-3468-221X",NA,NA,82,20,21,3,15,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0922-6028,1878-3627,NA,RESTOR NEUROL NEUROS,Restor.

Six short video clips depicting everyday life contexts were prepared. Three videoclips were used to elicit spontaneous conversation during treatment. The remaining three were presented only before and after the therapy. Participants were prompted to talk about the contents of each videoclip while stimulated with tDCS (20 min 1 mA) over the left hemisphere in three conditions: anodic tDCS over the Broca's area, anodic tDCS over the Wernicke's area, and a sham condition. Each experimental condition was performed for 10 consecutive daily sessions with 14 days of intersession interval. After stimulation over Broca's area, the participants produced more Content Units, verbs and sentences than in the remaining two conditions. Importantly, this improvement was still detectable 1 month after the end of treatment and its effects were generalized also to the three videoclips that had been administered at the beginning and at the end of the therapy sessions. In conclusion, anodic tDCS applied over the left Broca's area together with an intensive Conversational Therapy treatment improves informative speech in persons with chronic aphasia. We believe that positive tDCS effects may be further extended to other language domains, such as the recovery of speech production.","[Marangolo, Paola] Univ Politecn Marche, Fac Med, I-60020 Ancona, Italy; [Marangolo, Paola; Fiori, Valentina; Calpagnano, Maria A.; Campana, Serena; Razzano, Carmelina; Caltagirone, Carlo; Marini, Andrea] Ist Ricovero Carattere Sci Fdn Santa Lucia, Dept Clin & Behav Neurol, Rome, Italy; [Caltagirone, Carlo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Neurol, Rome, Italy; [Marini, Andrea] Univ Udine, Dipartimento Sci Umane, I-33100 Udine, Italy","Marangolo, P (reprint author), Univ Politecn Marche, Fac Med, Via Tronto 10-A, I-60020 Ancona, Italy.",p.marangolo@univpm.it,NA,"Campana, Serena/0000-0001-6791-100X; MARANGOLO, Paola/0000-0002-1516-9832; fiori, valentina/0000-0002-3468-221X; Marini, Andrea/0000-0002-6058-3864",NA,NA,72,48,55,5,42,FRONTIERS RESEARCH FOUNDATION,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 110, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5161,NA,NA,FRONT HUM NEUROSCI,Front.

It has been demonstrated that the SC based methods are quite effective in adapting DNNs even when only a very small amount of adaptation data is available. However, in this way we have to estimate speaker code for new speakers by an updating process and obtain the final results through two-pass decoding. In this paper, we propose an alternative d-code extraction method to replace SC based on modeling speaker information with BLSTM-RNN which makes one-pass decoding possible. After that, a speaker clustering approach is introduced to decrease the target number of speaker-BLSTM which accelerates training speed and improves ASR performance at the same time. Meanwhile, an interpolation method is provided for taking use of d-codes from training set to improve the recognition accuracy especially when adaptation data is limited. Experimental results on Switchboard task have shown that the proposed methods lead to a comparable relative reduction in WER (about 9%) as the standard SC based adaptation method without the need of two-pass decoding.","[Xue, Shaofei; Yan, Zhijie] Alibaba Inc, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Huang, Zhiying; Dai, Lirong] Univ Sci & Technol China, Natl Engn Lab Speech & Language Informat Proc, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China","Xue, SF (reprint author), Alibaba Inc, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.",shaofei.xsf@alibaba-inc.com; Zhijie.yzj@alibaba-inc.com; zyhuang@mail.ustc.edu.cn; lrdai@ustc.edu.cn,NA,NA,NA,NA,36,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",NA,NA,978-1-5090-4293-7,NA,NA,NA,2016,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Computer Science,BI1DZ,WOS:000405610900012,NA,NA,NA,NA,10/14/2018

Here, we explored the cardiotoxicity of the antiangiogenic therapy, sunitinib, in the mouse heart from a diagnostic and therapeutic perspective. We showed that sunitinib induces an anaerobic switch of cellular metabolism within the myocardium which is associated with the development of myocardial fibrosis and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction as demonstrated by echocardiography. The capacity of positron emission tomography with [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose to detect the changes in cardiac metabolism caused by sunitinib was dependent on fasting status and duration of treatment. Pan proteomic analysis in the myocardium showed that sunitinib induced (i) an early metabolic switch with enhanced glycolysis and reduced oxidative phosphorylation, and (ii) a metabolic failure to use glucose as energy substrate, similar to the insulin resistance found in type 2 diabetes. Co-administration of the endothelin receptor antagonist, macitentan, to sunitinib-treated animals prevented both metabolic defects, restored glucose uptake and cardiac function, and prevented myocardial fibrosis. These results support the endothelin system in mediating the cardiotoxic effects of sunitinib and endothelin receptor antagonism as a potential therapeutic approach to prevent cardiotoxicity. Furthermore, metabolic and functional imaging can monitor the cardiotoxic effects and the benefits of endothelin antagonism in a theranostic approach.","[Sourdon, Joevin; Viel, Thomas; Balvay, Daniel; Tharaux, Pierre-Louis; Tavitian, Bertrand] Univ Paris 05, INSERM UMR970, Paris Cardiovasc Res Ctr PARCC, Paris, France; [Lager, Franck; Bennana, Evangeline; Renault, Gilles] Univ Paris 05, Inst Cochin, INSERM U1016, F-75014 Paris, France; [Moorhouse, Rebecca] Queens Med Res Inst, Univ British Heart Fdn Ctr Cardiovasc Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Bennana, Evangeline] Univ Paris 05, Univ Sorbonne Paris Cite, Prote Facil 3P5, Paris, France; [Dhaun, Neeraj] Univ Edinburgh, Queens Med Res Inst, Univ British Heart Fdn Ctr Res Excellence, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Tavitian, Bertrand] Hop Europeen Georges Pompidou, AP HP, Serv Radiol, Paris, France","Tavitian, B (reprint author), Univ Paris 05, INSERM UMR970, Paris Cardiovasc Res Ctr PARCC, Paris, France.",bertrand.tavitian@inserm.fr,"Tavitian, Bertrand/P-6578-2018; Tharaux, Pierre-Louis/A-9155-2009","Tavitian, Bertrand/0000-0002-5349-8194; Tharaux, Pierre-Louis/0000-0002-6062-5905; Viel, Thomas/0000-0002-0756-9166; Balvay, Daniel/0000-0003-3802-2224","Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Paris Descartes University; France Life Imaging; Ministere de l'Enseignement Superieur et de la Recherche","This study was supported by the Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Paris Descartes University and France Life Imaging.

Synthetic events were generated for the entire river system of the Scheldt estuary. This estuary contains multiple navigable waterways and is situated in Belgium and the Netherlands. Extreme water levels are influenced by rainfall-runoff discharges, tiding, storm surges, and wind speed and direction. For the generation of hydraulic boundary conditions for flood risk assessment, these influences and their mutual dependencies and correlations are taken into account by means of a nested extreme value copula structure. The variation in time is taken into account by standardized profiles, computed by normalizing all recorded extreme events and fitting a probability distribution to the variation of the standardized events, yielding 5 profile classes through another stratification. Eventually this resulted in a total of 1920 sets of synthetic events. All events were run through the hydrodynamic model of the river system. The frequency distribution of the resulting water levels are calculated by accumulation of the corresponding probabilities of occurrence of the synthetic events at each location. The methodology has the advantage that it determines a statistical distribution of consequences, rather than assigning frequencies to hydrodynamic boundary conditions.","[Franken, Tim; Blanckaert, Joris; Leyssen, Gert] Int Marine & Dredging Consultants, Antwerp, Belgium","Franken, T (reprint author), Int Marine & Dredging Consultants, Antwerp, Belgium.",tim.franken@imdc.be,NA,NA,NA,NA,8,0,0,0,0,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2267-1242,NA,NA,E3S WEB CONF,NA,NA,2016,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,UNSP 01005,10.1051/e3sconf/20160701005,NA,NA,NA,10,"Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil; Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Planning & Development; Water Resources",Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Public Administration; Water Resources,BG8GU,WOS:000392270100005,NA,gold,NA,NA,10/14/2018

To increase SBA in rural, indigenous communities, a professional midwifery school accredited by the government is scheduled to open in 2017. Drawing from Filby's model on barriers to the successful integration of professional midwifery into health systems, this paper aims to identify threats - and facilitators-toward professional midwifery's re-introduction in Guatemala. Methods: To elucidate perceptions, attitudes and expectations towards professional midwifery, qualitative, in-depth interviews were conducted with 32 physicians, nurses, and TBAs in six health centers and with key decision makers and professional midwives (PMs) in Guatemala City. We conducted open and axial coding in Atlas.ti and performed normative comparisons of participants' attitudes, perceptions, and expectations with the National Vision for professional midwifery and relative comparisons within and across disciplinary subgroups. Results: Unprompted, physicians, nurses and TBAs were unable to correctly define professional midwifery. Yet, when professional midwifery was defined for them, they expressed willingness to work with PMs, seeing them as a needed human resource, instrumental in providing intercultural care and strengthening facility relationships with TBAs. Some stakeholders anticipated resistance toward PMs due to provider turf issues. Notable differences in expectations among all groups included ideas for supervision of and by the PMs and the PM's role in monitoring women and conducting births in communities alongside TBAs. Conclusions: Facilitators to professional midwifery's success include national political will, stakeholders' uniformity of vision, and the potential for improved intercultural care. Barriers are mostly professional in nature, including impediments to autonomous practice by PMs, hierarchical challenges, and turf issues. A specific road map addressing the identified barriers is needed for professional midwifery to succeed in reducing maternal health disparities in Guatemala. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Epileptic discharges are detectable on EEG/MEG scalp recordings only when associated with a spatially extended cortical generator of several square centimeters, therefore it is essential to assess the ability of source localization methods to recover such spatial extent. In this study we evaluated two source localization methods that have been developed for localizing spatially extended sources using EEG/MEG data: coherent Maximum Entropy on the Mean (cMEM) and 4th order Extended Source Multiple Signal Classification (4-ExSo-MUSIC). In order to propose a fair comparison of the performances of the two methods in MEG versus EEG, this study considered realistic simulations of simultaneous EEG/MEG acquisitions taking into account an equivalent number of channels in EEG (257 electrodes) and MEG (275 sensors), involving a biophysical computational neural mass model of neuronal discharges and realistically shaped head models. cMEM and 4-ExSo-MUSIC were evaluated for their sensitivity to localize complex patterns of epileptic discharges which includes (a) different locations and spatial extents of multiple synchronous sources, and (b) propagation patterns exhibited by epileptic discharges. Performance of the source localization methods was assessed using a detection accuracy index (Area Under receiver operating characteristic Curve, AUC) and a Spatial Dispersion (SD) metric. Finally, we also presented two examples illustrating the performance of cMEM and 4-ExSo-MUSIC on clinical data recorded using high resolution EEG and MEG. When simulating single sources at different locations, both 4-ExSo-MUSIC and cMEM exhibited excellent performance (median AUC significantly larger than 0.8 for EEG and MEG), whereas, only for EEG, 4-ExSo-MUSIC showed significantly larger AUC values than cMEM. On the other hand, cMEM showed significantly lower SD values than 4-ExSo-MUSIC for both EEG and MEG. When assessing the impact of the source spatial extent, both methods provided consistent and reliable detection accuracy for a wide range of source spatial extents (source sizes ranging from 3 to 20 cm(2) for MEG and 3 to 30 cm2 for EEG). For both EEG and MEG, 4-ExSo-MUSIC localized single source of large signal-to-noise ratio better than cMEM. In the presence of two synchronous sources, cMEM was able to distinguish well the two sources (their location and spatial extent), while 4-ExSo-MUSIC only retrieved one of them. cMEM was able to detect the spatio-temporal propagation patterns of two synchronous activities while 4-ExSo-MUSIC favored the strongest source activity. Overall, in the context of localizing sources of epileptic discharges from EEG and MEG data, 4-ExSo-MUSIC and cMEM were found accurately sensitive to the location and spatial extent of the sources, with some complementarities. Therefore, they are both eligible for application on clinical data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Antihypertensives can prevent many of the harmful effects of elevated blood pressure, but medication nonadherence is a known barrier to the effectiveness of these treatments.

Methods/design The MedISAFE-BP study is a prospective, randomized control trial designed to evaluate the impact on blood pressure and medication adherence of an mhealth application (Medisafe). Four hundred thirteen patients with uncontrolled hypertension have been enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 fashion to usual care or to the use of the Medisafe mhealth platform. Patients will be followed up for 12 weeks and the trial's co-primary outcomes will be change in systolic blood pressure and self-reported medication adherence.

The optimization efforts are aimed at maximizing net power production for all concerning cycles, the results show that the proposed cycle can produce 9% and 8% more power than the reference Kalina cycles, while a better thermal performance is achieved for thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency. When the proposed cycle compares with ORC, the amount of net power can be produced is improved by 9% and 3%, respectively. On the other hand, the thermal performance of Kalina cycles and ORC are largely relied on the design of internal heat exchangers, requiring relatively larger size of internal heat exchangers. The proposed cycle, however, is much more compact because of less amount of internal heat transfer needed, leading to less irreversibilities. The proposed cycle can be further simplified by using a solution cooled absorber which eventually decreases the system complexity. A parametrical study shows that the proposed cycle has a better capability of adaptation to a wider temperature range of heat source conditions while maintaining a better performance.

Therefore, three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) have been applied to HSI classification. However, a lack of HSI training samples restricts the performance of 3D-CNNs. To solve this problem and improve the classification, an improved method based on 3D-CNNs combined with parameter optimization, transfer learning, and virtual samples is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to optimize the network performance, the parameters of the 3D-CNN of the HSI to be classified (target data) are adjusted according to the single variable principle. Secondly, in order to relieve the problem caused by insufficient samples, the weights in the bottom layers of the parameter-optimized 3D-CNN of the target data can be transferred from another well trained 3D-CNN by a HSI (source data) with enough samples and the same feature space as the target data. Then, some virtual samples can be generated from the original samples of the target data to further alleviate the lack of HSI training samples. Finally, the parameter-optimized 3D-CNN with transfer learning can be trained by the training samples consisting of the virtual and the original samples. Experimental results on real-world hyperspectral satellite images have shown that the proposed method has great potential prospects in HSI classification.","[Liu, Xuefeng; Sun, Qiaoqiao; Meng, Yue] Qingdao Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Automat & Elect Engn, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xuefeng; Sun, Qiaoqiao; Bourennane, Salah] Ecole Cent Marseille, Inst Fresnel, F-13013 Marseille, France; [Fu, Min] Ocean Univ China, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China","Fu, M (reprint author), Ocean Univ China, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.",nina.xf.liu@hotmail.com; qiaoqiao.sunny@foxmail.com; xiangyue.meng@foxmail.com; fumin@ouc.edu.cn; salah.bourennane@fresnel.fr,NA,NA,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [61401244, 61773227]","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61401244, 61773227).",64,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2072-4292,NA,NA,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,SEP,2018,10,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1425,10.3390/rs10091425,NA,NA,NA,16,Remote Sensing,Remote Sensing,HA1QF,WOS:000449993800105,NA,DOAJ Gold,NA,NA,12/9/2018

They are combined into the unique framework and optimized simultaneously. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance in terms of true positive rate, false positive rate and the running time, as compared with state-of-the-art methods for inpainting forensics, and is very robust against JPEG compression and scaling manipulations.","[Zhu, Xinshan; Qian, Yongjun; Sun, Biao; Sun, Ya] Tianjin Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xinshan; Zhao, Xianfeng] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Informat Secur, Inst Informat Engn, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China","Sun, B (reprint author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",xszhu@tju.edu.cn; sunbiao@tju.edu.cn,NA,NA,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [60803122, 61401303, 61573253]; China Scholarship Fund [201506255067]; Opening Project of State Key Laboratory of Information Security [2017-MS-11]; Seed Foundation of Tianjin University [2017XZY-0090, 2018XZC-0033]","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 60803122, 61401303, and 61573253), by the China Scholarship Fund (Grant No. 201506255067), by the Opening Project of State Key Laboratory of Information Security (Grant No. 2017-MS-11), and by the Seed Foundation of Tianjin University (Grant No. 2017XZY-0090 and 2018XZC-0033).",44,0,0,9,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0923-5965,1879-2677,NA,SIGNAL PROCESS-IMAGE,Signal Process.-Image Commun.,SEP,2018,67,NA,NA,NA,NA,90,99,NA,10.1016/j.image.2018.05.015,NA,NA,NA,10,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Engineering,GQ2LT,WOS:000441487200009,NA,NA,NA,NA,10/15/2018

Generally, the performance of an intelligent recognition algorithm is greatly affected by different shooting angles, illumination conditions and backgrounds of the license plate images. This paper presents a sequence recognition approach for intelligent recognition of Chinese license plates. Firstly, a spatial transformer network (STN) is employed to adjust the inclined and deformed license plates such that all the plates have a uniform orientation and thus are easier to be recognized. Then, an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to extract sequence features of the rectified license plates. The features of different convolutional layers are integrated as input to a bi-directional recurrent neural network (BRNN), where the character segmentation is not needed. Finally, the recognition is accomplished by the BRNN and connectionist temporal classification (CTC). Due to the lack of adequate Chinese license plates, an effective training method is presented in which the network is pre-trained by sufficiently enough synthetic license plates and is fine-tuned by our collected real Chinese license plates.

However, due to inherent difficulties in both data acquisition and data analysis methods, studies on large-scale brain dynamics of mouse with local field potential (LFP) recording are very rare. In this paper, we did a series of works on modeling large-scale mouse brain dynamic activities responding to fearful earthquake. Based on LFP recording data from 13 brain regions that are closely related to fear learning and memory and the effective Bayesian connectivity change point model, we divided the response time series into four stages: Before, Earthquake, Recovery, and After. We first reported the changes in power and theta-gamma coupling during stage transitions. Then, a recurrent neural network model was designed to model the functional dynamics in these thirteen brain regions and six frequency bands in response to the fear stimulus. Interestingly, our results showed that the functional brain connectivities in theta and gamma bands exhibited distinct response processes: in theta band, there is a separated-united-separated alternation in whole-brain connectivity and a low-high-low change in connectivity strength; however, gamma bands have a united-separated-united transition and a high-low-high alternation in connectivity pattern and strength. In general, our results offer a novel perspective in studying functional brain dynamics under fearful stimulus and reveal its relationship to the brain's structural connectivity substrates.","[Wang, Han; Cui, Yan] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Biomed Engn & Instrument Sci, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xie, Kun] Yunnan Acad Sci & Technol, Banna Biomed Res Inst, Brain Decoding Ctr, Xishuangbanna 666100, Peoples R China; [Xie, Kun; Tsien, Joe] Augusta Univ, Brain & Behav Discovery Inst, Med Coll Georgia, Augusta, GA 30912 USA; [Lian, Zhichao] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yaowu] Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Network Multimedia Technol, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yaowu] Zhejiang Univ, Embedded Syst Engn Res Ctr, Minist Educ China, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jing] Georgia State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Xie, Li] Zhejiang Univ, State Key Lab Ind Control Technol, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Liu, Tianming] Univ Georgia, Dept Comp Sci, Bioimaging Res Ctr, Cort Architecture Imaging & Discovery Lab, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Liu, TM (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Dept Comp Sci, Bioimaging Res Ctr, Cort Architecture Imaging & Discovery Lab, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",sdzbwh@zju.edu.cn; kxie@augusta.edu; newlzcts@gmail.com; cuiy@zju.edu.cn; cyw@mail.bme.zju.edu.cn; jing.maria.zhang@gmail.com; xiehan@zju.edu.cn; jtsien@augusta.edu; tianming.liu@gmail.com,NA,"Cui, Yan/0000-0003-3627-3169; Wang, Han/0000-0001-5220-6084",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,The work of H.

Research of robot controlling based on electrocardiogram, electromyography, and electroencephalogram is a hot spot. In medical research, electrode arrays are commonly used as sensors for surface electromyograms. Although these sensors collect more accurate data and sampling at higher frequencies, they have no advantage in terms of portability and ease of use. In recent years, there are also some small surface electromyography sensors for research. The portability of the sensor and the calculation speed of the calculation method directly affect the development of the bionic prosthesis. A consumer-grade surface electromyography device is selected as surface electromyography sensor in this study. We first proposed a data structure to convert raw surface electromyography signals from an array structure into a matrix structure (we called it surface electromyography graph). Then, a convolutional neural network was used to classify it. Discrete surface electromyography signals recorded from three persons 14 gestures (widely used in other research to evaluate the performance of classifier) have been applied to train the classifier and we get an accuracy of 97.27%. The impacts of different components used in convolutional neural network were tested with this data, and subsequently, the best results were selected to build the classifier used in this article. The NinaPro database 5 (one of the biggest surface electromyography data sets) was also used to evaluate our method, which comprises of hand movement data of 10 intact subjects with two myo armbands as sensors, and the classification accuracy increased by 13.76% on average when using double myo armbands and increased by 18.92% on average when using single myo armband. In order to driving the robot hand (bionic manipulator), a group of continuous surface electromyography signals was recorded to train the classifier, and an accuracy of 91.72% was acquired. We also used the same method to collect a set of surface electromyography data from a disabled with hand lost, then classified it using the above mentioned network and achieved an accuracy of 89.37%. Finally, the classifier was deployed to the microcontroller to drive the bionic manipulator, and the full video URL is given in the conclusion, with both the healthy man and the disabled tested with the bionic manipulator.

Existing SVQA metrics rely on hand-crafted features, which is inaccurate and time-consuming because of the diversity and complexity of stereoscopic video distortion. This paper introduces a 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) based SVQA framework that can model not only local spatio-temporal information but also global temporal information with cubic difference video patches as input. First, instead of using hand-crafted features, we design a 3D CNN architecture to automatically and effectively capture local spatio-temporal features. Then we employ a quality score fusion strategy considering global temporal clues to obtain final video-level predicted score. Extensive experiments conducted on two public stereoscopic video quality datasets show that the proposed method correlates highly with human perception and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. We also show that our 3D CNN features have more desirable property for SVQA than hand-crafted features in previous methods, and our 3D CNN features together with support vector regression (SVR) can further boost the performance.

In this paper, by utilizing the Cross-view Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (XQDA) metric learning, we propose a novel scheme called deep multi-view feature learning (DMVFL), which exploits the collaboration between handcrafted and deep learning features in a simple but effective way. Furthermore, we prove that the XQDA is a robust algorithm. Extensive experiments on two challenging person re-identification data sets (VIPeR and GRID) demonstrate that DMVFL improves on current state-of-the-art methods.","[Tao, Dapeng] Yunnan Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yanan] Yunnan Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China; [Yu, Baosheng] Univ Sydney, UBTech Sydney Artificial Intelligence Inst, J12 Cleveland, Darlington, NSW 2008, Australia; [Yu, Baosheng] Univ Sydney, Sch Informat Technol, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, J12 Cleveland, Darlington, NSW 2008, Australia; [Pang, Jianxin] UBTECH Robot, Shenzhen 518000, Peoples R China; [Yu, Zhengtao] Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Informat Engn & Automat, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Tao, DP (reprint author), Yunnan Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Kunming 650091, Peoples R China.",dapeng.tao@gmail.com; yananguo.ynu@qq.com; bayu0826@uni.sydney.edu.au; walton@ubtrobot.com; ztyu@hotmail.com,NA,"Tao, Dapeng/0000-0003-0783-5273","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61572486, 61472168, 61672271, 61402458]; Yunnan Natural Science Funds [2016FB105]; Guangdong Natural Science Funds [2014A030310252]; Program for Excellent Young Talents of Yunnan University [WX069051]","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61572486, Grant 61472168, Grant 61672271, and Grant 61402458, in part by the Yunnan Natural Science Funds under Grant 2016FB105, in part by the Guangdong Natural Science Funds under Grant 2014A030310252, and in part by the Program for Excellent Young Talents of Yunnan University under Grant WX069051.",67,0,0,1,1,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1051-8215,1558-2205,NA,IEEE T CIRC SYST VID,IEEE Trans.

However, the existing deep learning models cannot effectively make use of the sentiment information in the sentence for sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose a Sentiment Information Collector-Extractor architecture based Neural Network (SICENN) for sentiment analysis consisting of a Sentiment Information Collector (SIC) and a Sentiment Information Extractor (SIE). The SIC based on the Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory structure aims at collecting the sentiment information in the sentence and generating the information matrix. The SIE takes the information matrix as input and extracts the sentiment information precisely via three different sub-extractors. A new ensemble strategy is applied to combine the results of different sub-extractors, making the SIE more universal and outperform any single sub-extractor. Experiments results show that the proposed architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three datasets of different language. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In HEVC, the quad-tree partition of the coding unit (CU) consumes a large proportion of the HEVC encoding complexity, due to the brute-force search for rate-distortion optimization (RDO). Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning approach to predict the CU partition for reducing the HEVC complexity at both intra- and inter-modes, which is based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and long- and short-term memory (LSTM) network. First, we establish a large-scale database including substantial CU partition data for the HEVC intra-and inter-modes. This enables deep learning on the CU partition. Second, we represent the CU partition of an entire coding tree unit in the form of a hierarchical CU partition map (HCPM). Then, we propose an early terminated hierarchical CNN (ETH-CNN) for learning to predict the HCPM. Consequently, the encoding complexity of intra-mode HEVC can be drastically reduced by replacing the brute-force search with ETH-CNN to decide the CU partition. Third, an ETH-LSTM is proposed to learn the temporal correlation of the CU partition. Then, we combine the ETH-LSTM and the ETH-CNN to predict the CU partition for reducing the HEVC complexity at inter-mode. Finally, experimental results show that our approach outperforms the other state-of-the-art approaches in reducing the HEVC complexity at both intra-and inter-modes.","[Xu, Mai; Li, Tianyi; Wang, Zulin; Yang, Ren; Guan, Zhenyu] Beihang Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Deng, Xin] Imperial Coll London, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England","Guan, ZY (reprint author), Beihang Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",guanzhenyu@buaa.edu.cn,NA,"Yang, Ren/0000-0003-4124-4186","NSFC [61573037, 61702028]; Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation [151061]",This work was supported in part by NSFC under Grant 61573037 and Grant 61702028 and in part by the Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation under Grant 151061.,43,3,3,28,28,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1057-7149,1941-0042,NA,IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS,IEEE Trans.

Deep learning algorithms typically require a large amount of training data to achieve high accuracy. In contrast, the size of SAR image datasets is often comparatively limited. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method, deep memory convolution neural networks (M-Net), to alleviate the problem of overfitting caused by insufficient SAR image samples. Based on the convolutional neural networks (CNN), M-Net adds an information recorder to remember and store samples' spatial features, and then it uses spatial similarity information of the recorded features to predict unknown sample labels. M-Net's use of this information recorder may cause difficulties for convergence if conventional CNN training methods were directly used to train M-Net. To overcome this problem, we propose a transfer parameter technique to train M-Net in two steps. The first step is to train a CNN, which has the same structure as the part of CNN incorporated in M-Net, to obtain initial training parameters. The second step applies the initialized parameters to M-Net and then trains the entire M-Net. This two-step training approach helps us to overcome the nonconvergence issue, and also reduces training time. We evaluate M-Net using the public benchmark MSTAR dataset, and achieve higher accuracy than several other well-known SAR image classification algorithms.","[Shang, Ronghua; Wang, Jiaming; Jiao, Licheng; Hou, Biao; Li, Yangyang] Xidian Univ, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Key Lab Intelligent Percept & Image Understanding, Minist Educ,Int Res Ctr Intelligent Percept & Com, Xian 710071, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Stolkin, Rustam] Univ Birmingham, Extreme Robot Lab, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England","Shang, RH (reprint author), Xidian Univ, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Key Lab Intelligent Percept & Image Understanding, Minist Educ,Int Res Ctr Intelligent Percept & Com, Xian 710071, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",rhshang@mail.xidian.edu.cn; tjnuwjm@gmail.com; lchjiao@mail.xidian.edu.cn; R.Stolkin@cs.bham.ac.uk; avcodec@hotmail.com; yyli@xidian.edu.cn,NA,NA,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [61773304, 61671350, 61371201, 1772399]","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61773304, Grant 61671350, Grant 61371201, and Grant 1772399.

We adopt a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to explore the long-term dependencies to predict the taxi destination as the multiple hidden layers of RNN can store these dependencies. However, the hidden layers of RNN are very sensitive to small perturbations to reduce the prediction accuracy when the amount of taxi trajectories is increasing. In order to improve the prediction accuracy of taxi destination and reduce the training time, we embed suprisal-driven zoneout (SDZ) to RNN, hence a taxi destination prediction method by regularized RNN with SDZ (TDPRS). SDZ can not only improve the robustness of TDPRS, but also reduce the training time by adopting partial update of parameters instead of a full update. Experiments with a Porto taxi trajectory data show that TDPRS improves the prediction accuracy by 12% compared to RNN prediction method in literature [4].

Therefore, a new time series model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), was developed in this study as an alternative to computationally expensive physical models. The proposed model is composed of an LSTM layer with another fully connected layer on top of it, with a dropout method applied in the first LSTM layer. In this study, the proposed model was applied and evaluated in five sub-areas of Hetao Irrigation District in arid northwestern China using data of 14 years (2000-2013). The proposed model uses monthly water diversion, evaporation, precipitation, temperature, and time as input data to predict water table depth. A simple but effective standardization method was employed to pre-process data to ensure data on the same scale. 14 years of data are separated into two sets: training set (2000-2011) and validation set (2012-2013) in the experiment. As expected, the proposed model achieves higher R-2 scores (0.789-0.952) in water table depth prediction, when compared with the results of traditional feed-forward neural network (FFNN), which only reaches relatively low R-2 scores (0.004-0.495), proving that the proposed model can preserve and learn previous information well. Furthermore, the validity of the dropout method and the proposed model's architecture are discussed. Through experimentation, the results show that the dropout method can prevent overfitting significantly. In addition, comparisons between the R-2 scores of the proposed model and Double-LSTM model (R-2 scores range from 0.170 to 0.864), further prove that the proposed model's architecture is reasonable and can contribute to a strong learning ability on time series data. Thus, one can conclude that the proposed model can serve as an alternative approach predicting water table depth, especially in areas where hydrogeological data are difficult to obtain.","[Zhang, Jianfeng; Zhang, Xiaoping] Wuhan Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yan; Yang, Jinzhong] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Ye, Ming] Florida State Univ, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Zhang, XP (reprint author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",xpzhang.math@whu.edu.cn,NA,"Ye, Ming/0000-0002-7080-0578; Zhang, Xiaoping/0000-0002-4433-805X","Natural Science Foundation of China [51790533, 11671313, 51779178]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0403301]; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province, China [2016CFB576]","The study was partially supported by Natural Science Foundation of China through Grants (51790533, 11671313, 51779178), National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFC0403301), Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province, China (2016CFB576).

Most current haze removal methods focus on point-to-point operations and utilize information in the spectral domain, without taking consideration of the multi-scale spatial information of haze. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale residual convolutional neural network (MRCNN) for haze removal of remote sensing images. MRCNN utilizes 3D convolutional kernels to extract spatial-spectral correlation information and abstract features from surrounding neighborhoods for haze transmission estimation. It takes advantage of dilated convolution to aggregate multi-scale contextual information for the purpose of improving its prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, residual learning is utilized to avoid the loss of weak information while deepening the network. Our experiments indicate that MRCNN performs accurately, achieving an extremely low validation error and testing error. The haze removal results of several scenes of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data show that the visibility of the dehazed images is significantly improved, and the color of recovered surface is consistent with the actual scene. Quantitative analysis proves that the dehazed results of MRCNN are superior to the traditional methods and other networks. Additionally, a comparison to haze-free data illustrates the spectral consistency after haze removal and reveals the changes in the vegetation index.","[Jiang, Hou; Lu, Ning] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Hou] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Lu, Ning] Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Lu, N (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.; Lu, N (reprint author), Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jh1225357498@gmail.com; lvn@lreis.ac.cn,NA,"Jianghou, Hou/0000-0002-5087-3446; Lu, Ning/0000-0003-1944-5096",Young Talent Fund of Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research [2015RC203],This work was supported by the Young Talent Fund of Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research (2015RC203).,62,0,0,9,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2072-4292,NA,NA,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,JUN,2018,10,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,945,10.3390/rs10060945,NA,NA,NA,24,Remote Sensing,Remote Sensing,GK9JI,WOS:000436561800139,NA,DOAJ Gold,NA,NA,12/9/2018

Clickbait dissatisfies users because the article content does not match their expectation. Thus, clickbait detection has attracted more and more attention recently. Traditional clickbait-detection methods rely on heavy feature engineering and fail to distinguish clickbait from normal headlines precisely because of the limited information in headlines. A convolutional neural network is useful for clickbait detection, since it utilizes pretrained Word2Vec to understand the headlines semantically, and employs different kernels to find various characteristics of the headlines. However, different types of articles tend to use different ways to draw users' attention, and a pretrained Word2Vec model cannot distinguish these different ways. To address this issue, we propose a clickbait convolutional neural network (CBCNN) to consider not only the overall characteristics but also specific characteristics from different article types. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional clickbait-detection algorithms and the TextCNN model in terms of precision, recall and accuracy.","[Zheng, Hai-Tao; Chen, Jin-Yuan; Yao, Xin; Jiang, Yong] Tsinghua Univ, Grad Sch Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Sangaiah, Arun Kumar] VIT Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India; [Zhao, Cong-Zhi] Giiso Informat Technol Co Ltd, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Zheng, HT (reprint author), Tsinghua Univ, Grad Sch Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",zheng.haitao@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn; jy-chen13@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; yaox14@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; sarunkumar@vit.ac.in; jiangy@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn; zhaocz@giiso.com,NA,"Sangaiah, Arun Kumar/0000-0002-0229-2460","Basic Scientific Research Program of Shenzhen City [JCYJ20160331184440545]; Shenzhen Science and Technology Project [CYZZ20150408152315667]; Cross fund of Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University [JC20140001]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61773229]","This research is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61773229), Shenzhen Science and Technology Project (Grant No. CYZZ20150408152315667), Basic Scientific Research Program of Shenzhen City (Grant No. JCYJ20160331184440545), and Cross fund of Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University (Grant No. JC20140001).",39,2,2,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-8994,NA,NA,SYMMETRY-BASEL,Symmetry-Basel,MAY,2018,10,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,138,10.3390/sym10050138,NA,NA,NA,12,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,GJ3LL,WOS:000435196300011,NA,DOAJ Gold,NA,NA,12/9/2018

However, since the deep models for learning DeCAF are generally pre-trained, the dimensionality of DeCAF is simply fixed to a constant number (e.g., 4096D). In this case, one may ask whether DeCAF is good enough for image classification and whether we can further improve its performance? In this paper, to answer these two challenging questions, we propose a new model called RS-DeCAF based on reducing and stretching the dimensionality of DeCAF. In the implementation of RS-DeCAF, we reduce the dimensionality of DeCAF using dimensionality reduction methods and increase its dimensionality by stretching the weight matrix between successive layers. To improve the performance of RS-DeCAF, we also present a modified version of RS-DeCAF by applying the fine-tuning operation. Extensive experiments on several image classification tasks show that RS-DeCAF not only improves DeCAF but also outperforms previous stretching approaches. More importantly, from the results, we find that RS-DeCAF can generally achieve the highest classification accuracy when its dimensionality is two to four times of that of DeCAF.","[Zhong, Guoqiang; Yan, Shoujun; Cai, Yajuan; Dong, Junyu] Ocean Univ China, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China; [Huang, Kaizhu] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, SIP, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China","Zhong, GQ (reprint author), Ocean Univ China, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.",gqzhong@ouc.edu.cn; yansj1942@outlook.com; Kaizhu.Huang@xjtlu.edu.cn; cyj-ouc@hotmail.com; dongjunyu@ouc.edu.cn,NA,"Zhong, Guoqiang/0000-0002-2952-6642","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61271405, 61403353]; Ph.D. Program Foundation of Ministry of Education Of China [20120132110018]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China","This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61271405, 61403353), the Ph.D. Program Foundation of Ministry of Education Of China (No. 20120132110018) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China.",40,3,3,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1866-9956,1866-9964,NA,COGN COMPUT,Cogn.

Significant structural characteristics such as solvent accessibility and contact number are essential for deriving restrains in modeling protein folding and protein 3D structure. Thus, accurately predicting these features is a critical step for 3D protein structure building. Results: In this study, we present DeepSacon, a computational method that can effectively predict protein solvent accessibility and contact number by using a deep neural network, which is built based on stacked autoencoder and a dropout method. The results demonstrate that our proposed DeepSacon achieves a significant improvement in the prediction quality compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we develop one regression convolutional neural network (RegressionCNN) which combines a holistic regression model and a convolutional neural network (CNN) together to determine boundary points' coordinates of RV directly and simultaneously. In our approach, we take the fully connected layers of CNN as the holistic regression model to perform RV segmentation, and the feature maps extracted by convolutional layers of CNN are converted into 1-D vector to connect holistic regression model. Such connection allows us to make full use of the optimization algorithm to constantly optimize the convolutional layers to directly learn the holistic regression model in the training process rather than separate feature extraction and regression model learning. Therefore, RegressionCNN can achieve optimally convolutional feature learning for accurately catching the regression features that are more correlated to RV regression segmentation task in training process, and this can reduce the latent mismatch influence between the feature extraction and the following regression model learning. We evaluate the performance of RegressionCNN on cardiac MR images acquired of 145 human subjects from two clinical centers. The results have shown that RegressionCNN's results are highly correlated (average boundary correlation coefficient equals 0.9827) and consistent with the manual delineation (average dice metric equals 0.8351).

Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods greatly on the performance of segmentation map.","[Shi, Qian; Liu, Xiaoping] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Shi, Qian; Liu, Xiaoping] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Key Lab Urbanizat & Geosimulat, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Xia] East China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China","Liu, XP (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Liu, XP (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Key Lab Urbanizat & Geosimulat, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",liuxp3@mail.sysu.edu.cn,NA,NA,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0604402, 2017YFB1001703]; China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation [2015M580753]; National Science Foundation of China [61601522]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41531176]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [17lgjc40]","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFA0604402, in part by the China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation under Grant 2015M580753, in part by the National Science Foundation of China under Grant 61601522, in part by the Key National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 41531176, in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFB1001703, and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant 17lgjc40.",43,4,4,15,15,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,NA,NA,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,NA,2018,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,25486,25494,NA,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2773142,NA,NA,NA,9,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,GH7KA,WOS:000433620700001,NA,DOAJ Gold,NA,NA,12/9/2018

Large-magnitude earthquakes and tsunamis triggered by earthquakes can kill thousands of people and cause millions of dollars worth of economic losses. The accurate prediction of large-magnitude earthquakes is a worldwide problem. In recent years, deep learning technology that can automatically extract features from mass data has been applied in image recognition, natural language processing, object recognition, etc., with great success. We explore to apply deep learning technology to earthquake prediction. We propose a deep learning method for continuous earthquake prediction using historical seismic events. First, we project the historical seismic events onto a topographic map. Taking Taiwan as an example, we generate the images of the dataset for deep learning and mark a label 1 or 0, depending on whether in the upcoming 30 days a greater than M6 earthquake will occur. Second, we train our deep leaning network model, using the images of the dataset. Finally, we make earthquake predictions, using the trained network model. The result shows that we can get the best result, when we predict earthquakes in the upcoming 30 days using data from the past 120 days. Here, we use R score as the performance metrics. The best R score is 0.303. Although the R score is not high enough, using the past 120 days' historic seismic event to predict the upcoming 30 days' biggest earthquake magnitude can be seen as the pattern of Taiwan earthquake because the R score is rather good compared to other datasets. The proposed method performs well without manually designing feature vectors, as in the traditional neural network method. This method can be applied to earthquake prediction in other seismic zones.","[Huang, J. P.; Wang, X.

Sequential data, such as time series/video frames, and event data are becoming more and more ubiquitous in a wide spectrum of application scenarios especially in the background of large data and deep learning. However, large data sets used in training modern machine-learning models, such as deep neural networks, are often affected by label noise. Existing noisy learning approaches mainly focus on building an additional network to clean the noise or find a robust loss function. Few works tackle this problem by exploiting sample correlations. In this paper, we propose BundleNet, a framework of sequential structure (named bundle-module, see Fig. 1) for deep neural networks to handle the label noise. The bundle module naturally takes into account sample correlations by constructing bundles of samples class-by-class, and treats them as independent inputs. Moreover, we prove that the bundle-module performs a form of regularization, which is similar to dropout as regularization during training. The regularization effect endows the BundleNet with strong robustness to the label noise. Extensive experiments on public data sets prove that the proposed approach is effective and promising.","[Li, Chenghua; Li, Gang; Cheng, Jian] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chunjie; Ding, Kun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, Pattern Recognit & Intelligent Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Lu, Hanqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, Natl Lab Pattern Recognit, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Li, Chenghua; Ding, Kun; Li, Gang; Cheng, Jian; Lu, Hanqing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chunjie] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Comp & Control Engn, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Jian] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, Res Ctr Brain Inspired Intelligence, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Cheng, J (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.; Cheng, J (reprint author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.; Cheng, J (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, Res Ctr Brain Inspired Intelligence, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",jcheng@nlpr.ia.ac.cn,NA,NA,National Natural Science Foundation of China [61332016]; Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Big Data Analysis Technology; 863 Program [2014AA015105],"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61332016, in part by the Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Big Data Analysis Technology, and in part by the 863 Program under Grant 2014AA015105.",71,0,0,3,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,NA,NA,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,NA,2018,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,2367,2377,NA,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2782844,NA,NA,NA,11,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,FX7NB,WOS:000426275700001,NA,DOAJ Gold,NA,NA,12/9/2018

The proposed architecture uses the framework of the recently developed NIN structure, which slides a universal approximator, such as a multilayer perceptron with rectifier units, across an image to extract features. However, the random initialization of NIN can produce poor solutions to gradient-based optimization. We use mlpconv-wise supervised pre-training to remedy this defect because this pre-training technique may contribute to overcoming the difficulties of training deep networks by better initializing the weights in all the layers. Moreover, batch normalization is applied to reduce internal covariate shift by pre-conditioning the model.

Significant structural characteristics such as solvent accessibility and contact number are essential for deriving restrains in modeling protein folding and protein 3D structure.

Results: In this study, we present DeepSacon, a computational method that can effectively predict protein solvent accessibility and contact number by using a deep neural network, which is built based on stacked autoencoder and a dropout method.

This paper designs a deep reinforcement learning framework for relation extraction, which considers relation extraction task as a two-step decision-making game. The method models relation mentions with CNN and Tree-LSTM, which can calculate initial state and transition state for the game respectively. In addition, we can tackle the problem of unbalanced corpus by designing penalty function which can increase the penalties for first-step decision-making errors. Finally, we use Q-Learning algorithm with value function approximation to learn control policy pi for the game. This paper sets up a series of experiments in ACE2005 corpus, which show that the deep reinforcement learning framework can achieve state-of-the-art performance in relation extraction task.","[Zhang, Hongjun; Feng, Yuntian; Hao, Wenning; Chen, Gang; Jin, Dawei] PLA Univ Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210007, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Feng, YT (reprint author), PLA Univ Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210007, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",fengyuntian2009@live.cn,NA,NA,NA,NA,18,0,0,4,23,IEICE-INST ELECTRONICS INFORMATION COMMUNICATIONS ENG,TOKYO,"KIKAI-SHINKO-KAIKAN BLDG, 3-5-8, SHIBA-KOEN, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-0011, JAPAN",1745-1361,NA,NA,IEICE T INF SYST,IEICE Trans.

In this letter, we propose a new feature fusion framework based on deep neural networks (DNNs). The proposed framework employs deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to effectively extract features of multi-/hyperspectral and light detection and ranging data. Then, a fully connected DNN is designed to fuse the heterogeneous features obtained by the previous CNNs. Through the aforementioned deep networks, one can extract the discriminant and invariant features of remote sensing data, which are useful for further processing. At last, logistic regression is used to produce the final classification results. Dropout and batch normalization strategies are adopted in the deep fusion framework to further improve classification accuracy. The obtained results reveal that the proposed deep fusion model provides competitive results in terms of classification accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed deep learning idea opens a new window for future remote sensing data fusion.","[Chen, Yushi; Li, Chunyang; Gu, Yanfeng] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Ghamisi, Pedram] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Remote Sensing Technol Inst IMF, D-82234 Wessling, Germany; [Ghamisi, Pedram] Tech Univ Munich, Signal Proc Earth Observat, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Jia, Xiuping] Univ New South Wales, Sch Engn & Informat Technol, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia","Chen, YS; Gu, YF (reprint author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",chenyushi@hit.edu.cn; lcy_buzz@mail.dlut.edu.cn; p.ghamisi@gmail.com; x.jia@adfa.edu.au; guyf@hit.edu.cn,NA,"Gu, Yanfeng/0000-0003-1625-7989; Chen, Yushi/0000-0003-2421-0996","State Key Laboratory of Frozen Soil Engineering [SKLFSE201614]; Natural Science Foundation of China [61301206, 61371180, 60972144]; National Science Foundation for Excellent Young Scholars [61522107]","This work was supported in part by the State Key Laboratory of Frozen Soil Engineering under Grant SKLFSE201614, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61301206, Grant 61371180, and Grant 60972144, and in part by the National Science Foundation for Excellent Young Scholars under Grant 61522107.

However, it is still a challenging task to fuse and classify these VHR images. Generally, there are two ways for the fusion and classification of panchromatic and MS images. One way is to use a panchromatic image to sharpen an MS image, and then classify a pan-sharpened MS image. Another way is to extract features from panchromatic and MS images, respectively, and then combine these features for classification. In this paper, we propose a superpixel-based multiple local convolution neural network (SML-CNN) model for panchromatic and MS images classification. In order to reduce the amount of input data for the CNN, we extend simple linear iterative clustering algorithm for segmenting MS images and generating superpixels. Superpixels are taken as the basic analysis unit instead of pixels. To make full advantage of the spatial-spectral and environment information of superpixels, a superpixel-based multiple local regions joint representation method is proposed. Then, an SML-CNN model is established to extract an efficient joint feature representation. A softmax layer is used to classify these features learned by multiple local CNN into different categories. Finally, in order to eliminate the adverse effects on the classification results within and between superpixels, we propose a multi-information modification strategy that combines the detailed information and semantic information to improve the classification performance. Experiments on the classification of Vancouver and Xi'an panchromatic and MS image data sets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","[Zhao, Wei; Jiao, Licheng; Ma, Wenping; Zhao, Jiaqi; Zhao, Jin; Liu, Hongying; Cao, Xianghai; Yang, Shuyuan] Xidian Univ, Key Lab Intelligent Percept & Image Understanding, Int Res Ctr Intelligent Percept & Computat, Minist Educ China,Sch Elect Engn, Xian 710071, Peoples R China","Zhao, W (reprint author), Xidian Univ, Key Lab Intelligent Percept & Image Understanding, Int Res Ctr Intelligent Percept & Computat, Minist Educ China,Sch Elect Engn, Xian 710071, Peoples R China.",weizhao_90@163.com; lchjiao@mail.xidian.edu.cn,NA,"Zhao, Jiaqi/0000-0002-3564-5090","National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China [2013CB329402]; Major Research Plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [91438201, 91438103]; Fund for Foreign Scholars in University Research and Teaching Programs (the 111 Project) [B07048]","This work was supported in part by the National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China under Grant 2013CB329402, in part by the Major Research Plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 91438201 and Grant 91438103, and in part by the Fund for Foreign Scholars in University Research and Teaching Programs (the 111 Project) under Grant B07048.

The large appearance variations of ground objects make this task quite challenging. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have shown outstanding performance in this task. A common strategy of these methods (e.g., SegNet) for performance improvement is to combine the feature maps learned at different DCNN layers. However, such a combination is usually implemented via feature map summation or concatenation, indicating that the features are considered indiscriminately. In fact, features at different positions contribute differently to the final performance. It is advantageous to automatically select adaptive features when merging different-layer feature maps. To achieve this goal, we propose a gated convolutional neural network to fulfill this task. Specifically, we explore the relationship between the information entropy of the feature maps and the label-error map, and then a gate mechanism is embedded to integrate the feature maps more effectively. The gate is implemented by the entropy maps, which are generated to assign adaptive weights to different feature maps as their relative importance. Generally, the entropy maps, i.e., the gates, guide the network to focus on the highly-uncertain pixels, where detailed information from lower layers is required to improve the separability of these pixels. The selected features are finally combined to feed into the classifier layer, which predicts the semantic label of each pixel. The proposed method achieves competitive segmentation accuracy on the public ISPRS 2D Semantic Labeling benchmark, which is challenging for segmentation by only using the RGB images.","[Wang, Hongzhen; Wang, Ying; Xiang, Shiming; Pan, Chunhong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, Natl Lab Pattern Recognit, 95 Zhongguancun East Rd, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hongzhen] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 101408, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qian] Alibaba Grp, Beijing 100102, Peoples R China","Xiang, SM (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, Natl Lab Pattern Recognit, 95 Zhongguancun East Rd, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",hongzhen.wang@nlpr.ia.ac.cn; ywang@nlpr.ia.ac.cn; zhangqiancsuia@163.com; smxiang@nlpr.ia.ac.cn; chpan@nlpr.ia.ac.cn,NA,"xiang, shi ming/0000-0002-2089-9733; wang, hong zhen/0000-0002-9190-582X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [91646207, 91338202, 91438105]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [4162064]","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 91646207, 91338202, 91438105, and the Beijing Natural Science Foundation under Grant 4162064.",47,10,10,7,29,MDPI AG,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2072-4292,NA,NA,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,MAY,2017,9,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,446,10.3390/rs9050446,NA,NA,NA,15,Remote Sensing,Remote Sensing,EW5VD,WOS:000402573700049,NA,DOAJ Gold,NA,NA,12/9/2018

Second, to further boost the image aesthetic quality classification performance, we employ the image content to train aesthetic quality classification models. But the training samples become smaller and only using once fine-tune can not make full use of the small-scale dataset. Third, to solve the problem in second step, a way of using twice fine-tune continually based on the aesthetic quality label and content label respective, is proposed. At last, the categorization probability of the trained CNN models is used to evaluate the image aesthetic quality. We experiment on the small-scale dataset Photo Quality. The experiment results show that the classification accuracy rates of our approach are higher than the existing image aesthetic quality evaluation approaches.","[Li, Yuxin; Pu, Yuanyuan; Xu, Dan; Qian, Wenhua; Wang, Lipeng] Yunnan Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Kunming 650504, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Pu, YY (reprint author), Yunnan Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Kunming 650504, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",km_pyy@126.com,NA,NA,"Natural Science Foundation of China [61271361, 61163019, 61462093, 61761046]; Research Foundation of Yunnan Province [2014FA021, 2014FB113]; Digital Media Technology Key Laboratory of Universities in Yunnan","It is a project supported by Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61271361, 61163019, 61462093, 61761046), the Research Foundation of Yunnan Province (2014FA021, 2014FB113), and Digital Media Technology Key Laboratory of Universities in Yunnan.",38,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",1865-0929,1865-0937,978-981-10-7302-1; 978-981-10-7301-4,COMM COM INF SC,NA,NA,2017,772,NA,NA,NA,NA,269,283,NA,10.1007/978-981-10-7302-1_23,NA,NA,NA,15,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence",Computer Science,BL3KY,WOS:000449831600023,NA,NA,NA,NA,12/10/2018

Firstly, the noise suppression of the noisy SAR image is carried out by using the fusion filtering algorithm, and then the convolution neural network is used to classify the image.

Second, each image is convoluted with Gabor filter with different orientations, and the feature map of the eight orientations of Chinese characters is extracted. Third, the feature map through Gabor filters and the original image are convoluted with learning kernels, and the results of the convolution is the input of pooling layer. Finally, the feature vector is used to classify and recognition. In addition, the generalization capacity of the network is improved by Dropout technology.

Nevertheless, there remains an open issue as how to effectively exploit description documents of both users and items in matrix factorization. In this paper, we proposed content embedding regularized matrix factorization (CERMF) to address this issue. CERMF adopts convolution neural networks to simultaneously generate the independent embedding representations for the users and the items. Then, dual embeddings are used to regularize the generation of latent models for users and items.

SPL selects instances based on their losses among the entire data set in each iteration. This probably causes that the selected instances are highly imbalanced, e.g., very few (even on) instances of some classes are chosen, and further negatively affects the training process. To address this issue, we propose a balanced self-paced learning (BSPL) scenario, which iteratively selects training samples based on their loss values from each class, instead of from the entire data set. From another perspective, learning with marginalized corrupted features is an approach to control overfitting by artificially corrupting the training data. However, feature corruption techniques typically lead to that the classification problem is non-convex and easily traps in local optima. To alleviate this, we propose balanced self-paced learning with feature corruption (BSPL-FC), which considers the instance sampling and feature corruption simultaneously. BSPL-FC first treats the feature corruption as a regularizer and then applies BSPL to solve the regularized classification problem. BSPL-FC inherently has advantages in controlling overfitting and avoiding local optima. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed model.","[Ren, Yazhou; Zhao, Peng; Xu, Zenglin] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Big Data Res Ctr, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Ren, Yazhou; Yao, Dezhong] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab NeuroInformat, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Ren, YZ (reprint author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Big Data Res Ctr, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.; Ren, YZ (reprint author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab NeuroInformat, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",yazhou.ren@uestc.edu.cn; pzhao201@std.uestc.edu.cn; zlxu@uestc.edu.cn; dyao@uestc.edu.cn,NA,NA,"Natural Science Foundation of China [61572111]; National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) [2015AA015408]; joint Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China; China Mobile Communication Corporation [MCM20150505]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M602674]; 985 Project of UESTC [A1098531023601041]; two Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [ZYGX2014J058, A03012023601042]","This paper was in part supported by Grants from the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61572111), the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) (No. 2015AA015408), the joint Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China and China Mobile Communication Corporation (No. MCM20150505), a Project funded by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(No. 2016M602674), a 985 Project of UESTC (No. A1098531023601041) and two Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (Nos.

In fact, the coding tree unit (CTU) partition consumes a large proportion of HEVC encoding complexity, due to the brute-force search for rate-distortion optimization (RDO). Therefore, we propose in this paper a complexity reduction approach for intra-mode HEVC, which learns a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to predict CTU partition instead of RDO. Firstly, we establish a large-scale database with diversiform patterns of CTU partition. Secondly, we model the partition as a three-level classification problem. Then, for solving the classification problem, we develop a deep CNN structure with various sizes of convolutional kernels and extensive trainable parameters, which can be learnt from the established database. Finally, experimental results show that our approach reduces intra-mode encoding time by 62.25% and 69.06% with negligible Bjontegaard delta bit-rate of 2.12% and 1.38%, over the test sequences and images respectively, superior to other state-of-the-art approaches.","[Li, Tianyi; Xu, Mai] Beihang Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Deng, Xin] Imperial Coll London, Commun & Signal Proc CSP Grp, London SW7 2AZ, England","Xu, M (reprint author), Beihang Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",maixu@buaa.edu.cn,NA,NA,"NSFC [61202139, 61573037]; Fok Ying-Tong education foundation [151061]","This work was supported by the NSFC projects under Grants 61573037 and 61202139, and Fok Ying-Tong education foundation under grant 151061.",25,4,4,2,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1945-7871,NA,978-1-5090-6067-2,IEEE INT CON MULTI,NA,NA,2017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1255,1260,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6,"Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Computer Science; Engineering,BJ6ZN,WOS:000426984300206,NA,NA,NA,NA,12/10/2018

In this paper, we first emphasize that the early saturation behavior of softmax will impede the exploration of SGD, which sometimes is a reason for model converging at a bad local-minima, then propose Noisy Softmax to mitigating this early saturation issue by injecting annealed noise in softmax during each iteration. This operation based on noise injection aims at postponing the early saturation and further bringing continuous gradients propagation so as to significantly encourage SGD solver to be more exploratory and help to find a better local-minima.

Our system is trained from end to end to map raw input images to direction in supervised mode. The images of data sets are collected in a wide variety of weather conditions and lighting conditions. Besides, the data sets are augmented by adding Gaussian noise and Salt-and-pepper noise to avoid over-fitting.

The line tracking experiment is proceeded in order to track the desired path which is composed of straight and curved lines. The goal of obstacle avoidance experiment is to avoid the obstacles indoor. Finally, we get 3.29% error rate on the training set and 5.1% error rate on the test set in the line tracking experiment, 1.8% error rate on the training set and less than 5% error rate on the test set in the obstacle avoidance experiment.

The biological activity of this kind of polysaccharides has been related with the presence and position of sulfate groups, and by the chemical composition of this kind of polysaccharides. A sulfated galactan (1000RS)was isolated from the tunic of the Brazilian ascidia Microcosmus exasperatus through proteolytic digestion, ethanol precipitation, dialysis and freeze-thaw cycles. Homogeneity and molecular weight were estimated by using size exclusion chromatography. Monosaccharide composition and type of linkage were assessed by Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and the sulfate content was quantified through gelatin/BaCl2 method. These experiments along with NMR and FTIR analysis allowed to claim that the galactan backbone is mainly composed of 4-linked alpha-L-Galp units. In addition, they permitted to establish that some of the galactose residues are sulfated at the 3-position.

In recent years, also nanoscale UCA like nanobubbles (NB), echogenic liposomes (ELIP) and nanodroplets have been developed, which in contrast to MB, are able to extravasate from the vessels into the tissue. New disease-specific UCA have been designed for the assessment of tissue biomarkers and advanced US to a molecular imaging modality. For this purpose, specific binding moieties were coupled to the UCA surface. The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and P-/E-selectin are prominent examples of molecular US targets to visualize tumor blood vessels and inflammatory diseases, respectively. Besides their application in contrast-enhanced imaging, MB can also be employed for drug delivery to tumors and across the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

The two different methods of silica gel chelation, such as chemical immobilization with the help of silane coupling agents (3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) and 3-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane (APTMS) in this study) and direct physical adsorption onto the silica surface, is compared in terms of their REE removal efficiency. A comparative analysis between adsorption of different REEs for different silica gels is performed and the influence of parameters such as pH, contact time, temperature and initial concentration has been reported. The effect of calcined adsorbents on the adsorption process is also investigated. Characterization studies on silica gels by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and zeta potential analysis are performed to better understand the relation between physical/chemical attributes of the adsorbents and their impact on the adsorption process. The experimental results are evaluated and optimal conditions for REE adsorption are identified. Chemically immobilized gels demonstrated immense potential for all the REE under study except Sc, for which, physically, loaded gels seemed to be more efficient. The removal of REEs could be achieved at lower pHs by chemically immobilized PAN/Acac gels, making it suitable for many practical applications.

The result shows that CO, CO2, CO+CO2 and TDCG have strong correlations with transformer age. The strongest correlation is between CO and transformer age with correlation coefficient 0.715. Trend analysis of CO and CO2 are carried out from transformer with various loading factors while the capacity and rated voltage are remained the same. The capacity of transformers discussed is 60MVA with rated voltage 150/20kV and 150/70kV. Loading factors of transformer ranges from 20 to 70%. Trend analysis shows that Transformer with higher loading factor will produce CO and CO2 more than transformer with lower loading factors. Higher loading factor in transformers will also cause CO and CO2 in its oil insulation increase faster.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Prasojo, Rahman Azis/0000-0003-3192-2449",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,978-1-4799-7675-1,NA,NA,NA,2017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,243,247,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000426923800045,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is important to highlight that in vivo cells experience a diverse range of oxygen tensions depending on the resident tissue type, which can also be recreated in vitro using specialized cell culture instruments that regulate external oxygen concentrations While cell-culture conditions can be readily adjusted using state-of-the-art incubators, the control of physiological-relevant microenvironments within the microfluidic chip, however, requires the integration of oxygen sensors. Although several sensing approaches have been reported to monitor oxygen levels in the presence of cell monolayers, oxygen demands of microfluidic three-dimensional (3D)-cell cultures and spatio-temporal variations of oxygen concentrations inside two-dimensional (2D) and 3D cell culture systems are still largely unknown. To gain a better understanding on available oxygen levels inside organ-on-a-chip systems, we have therefore developed two different microfluidic devices containing embedded sensor arrays to monitor local oxygen levels to investigate (i) oxygen consumption rates of 2D and 3D hydrogel-based cell cultures, (ii) the establishment of oxygen gradients within cell culture chambers, and (iii) influence of microfluidic material (e.g., gas tight vs. gas permeable), surface coatings, cell densities, and medium flow rate on the respiratory activities of four different cell types. We demonstrate how dynamic control of cyclic normoxic-hypoxic cell microenvironments can be readily accomplished using programmable flow profiles employing both gas-impermeable and gas-permeable microfluidic biochips.","[Zirath, Helene; Rothbauer, Mario; Spitz, Sarah; Bachmann, Barbara; Jordan, Christian; Harasek, Michael; Ertl, Peter] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Appl Synthet Chem, Inst Chem Technol & Analyt, Inst Chem Environm & Biosci Engn, Vienna, Austria; [Zirath, Helene; Rothbauer, Mario; Spitz, Sarah; Bachmann, Barbara; Priglinger, Eleni; Muehleder, Severin; Redl, Heinz; Holnthoner, Wolfgang; Ertl, Peter] Austrian Cluster Tissue Regenerat, Vienna, Austria; [Bachmann, Barbara; Priglinger, Eleni; Muehleder, Severin; Redl, Heinz; Holnthoner, Wolfgang] Ludwig Boltzmann Inst Expt & Clin Traumatol, Allgemeine Unfallversicherungsanstalt AUVA Res Ct, Vienna, Austria; [Mueller, Bernhard; Ehgartner, Josef; Mayr, Torsten] Graz Univ Technol, Inst Analyt Chem & Food Chem, NAWI Graz, Graz, Austria","Zirath, H; Rothbauer, M (reprint author), Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Appl Synthet Chem, Inst Chem Technol & Analyt, Inst Chem Environm & Biosci Engn, Vienna, Austria.; Zirath, H; Rothbauer, M (reprint author), Austrian Cluster Tissue Regenerat, Vienna, Austria.",helene.zirath@tuwien.ac.at; mario.rothbauer@tuwien.ac.at,NA,"Zirath, Helene/0000-0001-7772-4099",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [685817]; Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) [849791]; TU Wien University Library through its Open Access Funding Program,This work was funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (685817) and the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG; 849791).

For cytotherapy, cells are conventionally expanded in ambient oxygen (21% O-2) which represents hyperoxia compared to the oxygen tension of niches. Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) are then transplanted to host tissue with lower-O-2 levels. The high-O-2 gradient can reduce the efficacy of cultured cells. Based on the assumption that minimizing injury due to O-2 gradients will enhance the yield of functionally efficient cells, CDCs were cultured in 3% O-2 and compared with cells maintained in ambient O-2. CDCs were isolated from human right atrial explants and expanded in parallel in 21 and 3% oxygen and compared with regard to survival, proliferation, and retention of stemness. Increased cell viability even in the tenth passage and enhanced cardiosphere formation was observed in cells expanded in 3% O-2. The cell yield from seven passages was fourfold higher for cells cultured in 3% O-2. Preservation of stemness in hypoxic environment was evident from the proportion of c-kit-positive cells and reduced myogenic differentiation. Hypoxia promoted angiogenesis and reduced the tendency to differentiate to noncardiac lineages (adipocytes and osteocytes). Mimicking the microenvironment at transplantation, when shifted to 5% O-2, viability and proliferation rate were significantly higher for CDCs expanded in 3% O-2. Expansion of CDCs, from atria in sub-physiological oxygen, helps in obtaining a higher yield of healthy cells with better preservation of stem cell characteristics. The cells so cultured are expected to improve engraftment and facilitate myocardial regeneration.","[RajendranNair, Deepthi Sreerengam; Nair, Renuka R.] Sree ChitraTirunal Inst Med Sci & Technol, Div Cellular & Mol Cardiol, Thiruvananthapuram 695011, Kerala, India; [Karunakaran, Jayakumar] SreeChitraTirunal Inst Med Sci & Technol, Dept Cardiovasc & Thorac Surg, Thiruvananthapuram 695011, Kerala, India","Nair, RR (reprint author), Sree ChitraTirunal Inst Med Sci & Technol, Div Cellular & Mol Cardiol, Thiruvananthapuram 695011, Kerala, India.",deepthynair9@gmail.com; jay@sctimst.ac.in; renuka@sctimst.ac.in,NA,NA,"Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment; Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India","The authors thank the Director, SCTIMST for the facilities provided and the permission to publish the paper.

It is hypothesized that increasing the take-off angles of the left coronary artery will significantly increase or decrease the likelihood of plaque (atherosclerosis) buildup in the left coronary artery bifurcations. Specifically, this study quantified the effects of the varying take-off angles on the branches along the left anterior descending (LAD) of the left coronary artery using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The study compared five test cases of the different take off-angles of the left coronary artery (LCA) and four different branch angles between the LAD and the left circumflex (LCx). It also considered the branch angles of the coronary artery downstream the LAD. The LCA inlet boundary conditions was set as a pulsatile mass flow inlet and flow split ratios were set for the outlets boundary conditions. The nature of blood pulsatile flow characteristic was accounted for and the properties of blood which include the density (1,050 kg/m(3)) and dynamic viscosity (0.0046 Pa-s) were obtained from previous research. The results from the simulations are compared using established scales for the parameters evaluated. The parameters evaluated were: (i) Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI); which quantifies the extent in which the blood flow changes direction during a cardiac cycle (ii) Time Average Wall Shear Stress (TAWSS); which quantifies the average shear stress experienced by the wall of the artery and (iii) Relative Residence Time (RRT); which quantifies how long blood spends in a location along the artery during blood flow. These parameters are used to predict the likelihood of blood clots, atherosclerosis, endothelial damage, plaque formation, and aneurysm in the blood vessels. The data from the simulations were analyzed using functional macros to quantify and generate threshold values for the parameters.","[Asiruwa, John J.; Propst, Aaron M.; Gent, Stephen P.] South Dakota State Univ, Brookings, SD 57007 USA","Asiruwa, JJ (reprint author), South Dakota State Univ, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,16,0,0,0,0,AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",NA,NA,978-0-7918-5836-3,NA,NA,NA,2018,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,UNSP V003T04A023-1,NA,NA,NA,NA,10,"Engineering, Biomedical; Engineering, Mechanical",Engineering,BJ8MG,WOS:000428481100023,NA,NA,NA,NA,10/15/2018

This problem is so important that special spacecrafts are designed to clean up the trash. Ceramic-polymer composite panels have some advantages. However, the characteristics of such panel components have not been studied sufficiently yet. The finite element analysis is an efficient method for the composite characteristics improvement. Obviously, such improvement necessitates searching for a rich variety of composites characteristic. Each option requires creating a brick elements mesh. Adequate FE models have to be developed for penetrators (metal cones, for example) as well as for panels. Voxel based micro modeling makes it possible to develop a composite structure parametrical model. Further on, it is easy to transform this model to FE one. Developing a material model is an important problem of the impact simulation. To study the ceramic-polymer composite behavior using a traditional Johnson-Holmquist model and the most recent Toughened Adhesive Polymer model is suggested. The calculations using LS-DYNA give initial adequate results for impact modeling and thus the suggested approaches of geometrical and of FE modeling are rather effective. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Each sequence is subject to five Packet Error Rates (PER) with five trials each and with a bitrate of 32kbps and 128 kbps. Afterwards, the PSNR for each frame is calculated. The frame PSNRs would then be used to calculate the average PSNR for each sequence. To generate the error patterns, a simulation of a wireless channel is created using Network Simulator (NS2). The simulation was modeled using Rayleigh fading and two-state Markov error model. The information resulting from this is used to allow the decoder to determine which slices are set for concealment.

However, the renoprotective effect of scoparone under diabetic conditions remains elusive. Thus, the present study was undertaken to examine the role of scoparone in high glucose-induced mesangial cell proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation and elucidate the possible mechanism of action of scoparone. Our results demonstrated that treatment with scoparone significantly inhibited the proliferation of mesangial cells under high glucose conditions. In addition, scoparone reversed high glucose-induced fibronectin and collagen IV expression in mesangial cells, as well as suppressed reactive oxygen species production and NOX2/4 expression in high glucose-exposed mesangial cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that scoparone prevented the activation of ERK1/2 signaling pathway in high glucose-exposed mesangial cells, and an ERK inhibitor (U0126) protected mesangial cells treated with high glucose. Taken together, these results demonstrated that scoparone protects mesangial cells against high glucose damage in part through the inactivation of ERK signaling pathway. These findings suggest that scoparone may represent a potential drug for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.","[Wang, Yunqian; Chen, Baoping; Shi, Jun] Henan Univ, Huaihe Hosp, Dept Nephrol, 115 Ximen St, Kaifeng 475000, Henan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Min] Henan Univ, Huaihe Hosp, Dept Endocrinol, Kaifeng 475000, Henan, Peoples R China","Wang, YQ (reprint author), Henan Univ, Huaihe Hosp, Dept Nephrol, 115 Ximen St, Kaifeng 475000, Henan, Peoples R China.",yunqiany_wang@163.com,NA,NA,NA,NA,28,2,2,1,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0014-2999,1879-0712,NA,EUR J PHARMACOL,Eur.

It is possible to use the encryption in order to secure the calls. However, VoIP is a real time application and using encryption degrades the quality of service (QoS) by increasing the delay and the jitter. In this paper, we propose the use of the Blowfish encryption algorithm to encrypt the audio communication between the VoIP clients as the used algorithm was previously compared to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, and it was shown that it is faster and it offers a better throughput. In this study, we developed VoIP clients and we performed many experimental tests on these clients with the implemented algorithm in order to provide security without degradation of the quality of calls.

The objective of this study was to investigate the pregnancy rates from cattle with deficient, marginal and adequate Cu plasma concentration at the beginning of artificial insemination protocol. Moreover, we determined Cu concentrations present in bovine oviductal fluid (OF), and the effects of Cu on fertilizing ability of bovine spermatozoa. Also, the presence of Cu transporter, SLC31A1 (also known as CTR1), in spermatozoa and in vitro matured oocyte were investigated. We found no differences in pregnancy rates among animals with adequate, marginal, and deficient Cu concentrations measured in plasma at the beginning of fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) protocol. Copper concentrations in OF were 383 +/- 2.17 mu g/dL (mean +/- SEM) regardless of cupremia levels. The addition of 40 mu g/dL Cu to IVF medium enhanced total and progressive motility, sperm viability, functional sperm membrane integrity (HOST), sperm zona binding, and pronuclear formation. On the other hand, the presence of Cu in IVF medium did not modify acrosome integrity and cleavage rates after IVF, but impaired blastocyst rates. Cu transporter SLC31A1 was detected in bovine spermatozoa in the apical segment of acrosome, and in the oocyte matured in vitro. In conclusion, the results obtained in the present study determined that cupremia levels at the beginning of FTAI protocol did not influence the pregnancy rates at 60 d after insemination. The presence of CTR1 in bovine mature oocyte and spermatozoa, as well as the beneficial effect of Cu on sperm quality would suggest an important role of this mineral during the fertilization process.

The discovery of additional genes that harbor CMT2-causing mutations increasingly depends on sharing sequence data on a global level. In this way-by combining data from seven countries on four continents-we were able to define mutations in ATP1A1, which encodes the alpha1 subunit of the Na+, K+-ATPase, as a cause of autosomal-dominant CMT2. Seven missense changes were identified that segregated within individual pedigrees: c.143T>G (p.Leu48Arg), c.1775T>C (p.Ile592Thr), c.1789G>A (p.Ala597Thr), c.1801_1802delinsTT (p.Asp601Phe), c.1798C>G (p.Pro600Ala), c.1798C>A (p.Pro600Thr), and c.2432A>C (p.Asp811Ala). Immunostaining peripheral nerve axons localized ATP1A1 to the axolemma of myelinated sensory and motor axons and to Schmidt-Lanterman incisures of myelin sheaths.

However, it is difficult to collect fresh and uncontaminated hemolymph from adult bees since they are very active and have the potential to sting, and because hemolymph is rapidly melanized. Here we aimed to develop and test a quick and easy method for sterile and contamination-free hemolymph sampling from adult Apidae. Our novel antennae method for hemolymph sampling (AMHS), entailed the detachment of an antenna, followed by application of delicate pressure to the bee's abdomen. This resulted in the appearance of a drop of hemolymph at the base of the detached antenna, which was then aspirated using an automatic pipetter. Larger insect size corresponded to easier and faster hemolymph sampling, and to a greater sample volume. We obtained 80-100 mu L of sterile non-melanized hemolymph in 1 minute from one Bombus terrestris worker, in 6 minutes from 10 Apis mellifera workers, and in 15 minutes from 18 Apis cerana workers (+/-0.5 minutes). Compared to the most popular method of hemolymph collection, in which hemolymph is sampled by puncturing the dorsal sinus of the thorax with a capillary (TCHS), significantly fewer bees were required to collect 80-100 mu L hemolymph using our novel AMHS method. Moreover, the time required for hemolymph collection was significantly shorter using the AMHS compared to the TCHS, which protects the acquired hemolymph against melanization, thus providing the highest quality material for biological analysis.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1932-6203,NA,NA,NA,NA,26-Jan,2017,12,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,e0170487,10.1371/journal.pone.0170487,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000396176100103,28125668,NA,NA,NA,NA

Part II: Sweep/countercurrent design and field test,JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Membrane technology is an attractive alternative to conventional glycol dehydrators for natural gas dehydration. While membranes with high water/methane selectivity are available, the separation performance of membrane systems is restricted by the moderate feed-to-permeate pressure ratio encountered in this application, resulting in high membrane area requirement and high methane loss. This paper (Part II of a two-part study) addresses that challenge by evaluating suitable process designs to overcome the limitations of feed-to-permeate pressure ratio, using a process simulation package. A design with a dry gas on the permeate side as a countercurrent sweep shows the best combination of low methane loss and minimum membrane area requirement. The design was experimentally evaluated by field testing a spiral-wound module that incorporates countercurrent operation, at a natural gas processing plant. The use of a dry sweep gas on the permeate side significantly increased water vapor flux across the membrane. For example, as sweep/feed flow rate ratio increased from 0% to 5.9% at a permeate pressure of 4.8 bar, water flux increased by 2.5 times, from 0.13 slpm/m(2) (standard liter per minute per m(2) membrane area) to 0.47 slpm/m(2). The measured water flux reached about 80% of the value calculated with the process simulation package for a perfect sweep/countercurrent module, confirming the suitability of the spiral-wound modules with countercurrent configuration for natural gas dehydration.

Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on search engines that are selected on the basis of Alexa (Actionable Analytics for the web) Rank. Alexa listed top 500 sites, namely, search engines, portals, directories, social networking sites, networking tools, etc. But the scope of study is confined to only general search engines on the basis of language which was confined to English. Therefore only two general search engines are selected for the study. Alexa reports Google.com as the most visited website worldwide and Yahoo. com as the fourth most visited website globally. A total of 15 queries were selected randomly from PG students of Department of Library and Information Science during a period of eight days (from May 8 to May 15, 2014) which are classified manually into navigational, informational and transactional queries. However, queries are largely distributed on the two selected search engines to check their retrieval effectiveness as a training data set in order to define some characteristics of each type. Each query was submitted to the selected search engines which retrieved a large number of results but only the first 30 results were evaluated to limit the study in view of the fact that most of the users usually look up under the first hits of a query. Findings - The study estimated the precision and relative recall of Google and Yahoo. Queries using concepts in the field of Library and Information Science were tested and were divided into navigational queries, informational queries and transactional queries. Results of the study showed that the mean precision of Google was high with (1.10) followed by Yahoo with (0.88). While as, mean relative recall of Google was high with (0.68) followed by Yahoo with (0.31), respectively.

Furthermore, based on our results, we discuss future directions and opportunities for CAD research. First, in contrast to the typical hypothetical approach, the data-driven approach has shown promise. Second, the normalization of the test datasets and an evaluation method is necessary when adopting an algorithm and a system.

It has been demonstrated that the SC based methods are quite effective in adapting DNNs even when only a very small amount of adaptation data is available. However, in this way we have to estimate speaker code for new speakers by an updating process and obtain the final results through two-pass decoding. In this paper, we propose an alternative d-code extraction method to replace SC based on modeling speaker information with BLSTM-RNN which makes one-pass decoding possible. After that, a speaker clustering approach is introduced to decrease the target number of speaker-BLSTM which accelerates training speed and improves ASR performance at the same time. Meanwhile, an interpolation method is provided for taking use of d-codes from training set to improve the recognition accuracy especially when adaptation data is limited.

In semiconductor manufacturing, strategies for problem solving can be explained in terms of Shannon's entropy formula, which indicates the most effective pathway for reducing nescience and identifying the practice with the highest benefit/cost ratio. In medical diagnostics, variants of this formula can be used to reduce nescience to improve the quality of diagnosis.

The risk of cancer is higher in tissues in closest contact on ingestion of alcohol, such as the oral cavity, pharynx and esophagus. However, since ethanol is not mutagenic and the carcinogenic metabolite of ethanol (acetaldehyde) is mostly produced in the liver, it is not clear why alcohol use preferentially exerts a local carcinogenic effect. It is well known that ethanol causes cell death at the concentrations present in alcoholic beverages; however, this effect may have been overlooked because dead cells cannot give rise to cancer. Here I discuss that the cytotoxic effect of ethanol on the cells lining the oral cavity, pharynx and esophagus activates the division of the stem cells located in deeper layers of the mucosa to replace the dead cells. Every time stem cells divide, they become exposed to unavoidable errors associated with cell division (e.g., mutations arising during DNA replication and chromosomal alterations occurring during mitosis) and also become highly vulnerable to the genotoxic activity of DNA-damaging agents (e.g., acetaldehyde and tobacco carcinogens). Alcohol consumption may increase the risk of developing cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx and esophagus by promoting the accumulation of cell divisions in the stem cells that maintain these tissues in homeostasis. Understanding the mechanisms of carcinogenicity of alcohol is important to reinforce the epidemiological evidence and to raise public awareness of the strong link between alcohol consumption and cancer.

For example, lung cancer is diagnosed hundreds of times more often at age 70 than at age 20, and lung cancer in nonsmokers occurs thousands of times more frequently than heart cancer in smokers. An analysis of these differences using basic concepts in cell biology indicates that cancer is the end-result of the accumulation of cell divisions in stem cells. In other words, the main determinant of carcinogenesis is the number of cell divisions that the DNA of a stem cell has accumulated in any type of cell from the zygote. Cell division, process by which a cell copies and separates its cellular components to finally split into two cells, is necessary to produce the large number of cells required for living. However, cell division can lead to a variety of cancer-promoting errors, such as mutations and epigenetic mistakes occurring during DNA replication, chromosome aberrations arising during mitosis, errors in the distribution of cell-fate determinants between the daughter cells, and failures to restore physical interactions with other tissue components. Some of these errors are spontaneous, others are promoted by endogenous DNA damage occurring during quiescence, and others are influenced by pathological and environmental factors. The cell divisions required for carcinogenesis are primarily caused by multiple local and systemic physiological signals rather than by errors in the DNA of the cells. As carcinogenesis progresses, the accumulation of DNA errors promotes cell division and eventually triggers cell division under permissive extracellular environments. The accumulation of cell divisions in stem cells drives not only the accumulation of the DNA alterations required for carcinogenesis, but also the formation and growth of the abnormal cell populations that characterize the disease. This model of carcinogenesis provides a new framework for understanding the disease and has important implications for cancer prevention and therapy.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1040-8428,1879-0461,NA,NA,NA,MAR,2018,123,NA,NA,NA,NA,95,113,NA,10.1016/j.critrevonc.2018.01.010,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000428606400009,29482784,NA,NA,NA,NA

Due to this, gear design has become a complicated art.A considerable amount of research has been carried out to determine the amount of dynamic gear tooth loads acting.The findings of the dynamic load between the gear teeth results in difficulty for the designer.In this paper, an effort has been made to formulate a simple design procedure for calculating the dynamic load.Earlier the stiffness characteristics and deformation of the gear tooth were studied to predict the dynamic load acting. This was developed with the tooth assumed as a short cantilever.Whereas in reality, an involute profile exists in a spur gear tooth.Based on this reality, work has been done to model the exact profile of the tooth.Later,the stiffness characteristics were carefully analysed and an improvement was thus made. It was proved that FEA is one such technique that can be used for predicting dynamic loads acting on a gear tooth.","[Balambica, V.] Salalah Inst Technol, Salalah, Oman; [Prabhu, T.

This is based on the original algorithm of FLIP-MHD, which uses a Lagrangian formulation of the macroscopic equations. A finite-difference approximation of the equations of motion is solved on a fixed (non-moving) grid, while convection of the quantities is modeled with the support of Lagrangian particles. Interpolation with first-order b-splines is used to project the conserved quantities from particles to the grid and back. In this work, we introduce two modifications of the original scheme. A particle volume evolution procedure is adopted to reduce the computational error, based on the formulation used in the Material Point Method for computational mechanics. The additional step introduces little to none computational diffusion and turns out to efficiently suppress the so-called ringing instability, allowing the use of explicit time differencing. Furthermore, we eliminate the need for a Poisson solver in the magnetic field computation with the use of a vector potential in place of the particles' magnetic moment. The vector potential evolution is modeled with a moving grid and interpolated to the fixed grid points at each time step to obtain a solenoidal magnetic field. The method is tested with a number of standard hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic tests to show the efficiency of the new approach. The results show good agreement with the reference solutions and rather fast time and space convergence. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Magnetic nanocomposites were qualified by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Vibrational Sample Magnetometer (VSM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Results showed that nanoparticles were synthesized successfully with good dispersion of magnetic nanoparticles in cavity, uniform particle size distribution with average size of 65 nm and high magnetization of 33.75 emu/mg. Furthermore, the nano-porosity and magnetism allowed high efficiency and remote controlled drug release. In this study, anti-migraine Sumatriptan was used as drug sample and the effect of drug concentration, Fe/Sn ratio and loading time on drug absorption were investigated. The best result was checked for stability at body temperature and different body pH. The sample with drug concentration of 0.25(mg/ml), Fe/Sn = 0.22 and loading time of 1.5 h had the highest drug efficiency (70%). Finally, in order to simulate the in vivo process for in-vitro step, Amnion was used and drug diffusion rate was measured in different intervals and different pH values. The result illustrated that after 25 h, diffusion reached 65% at pH = 2 and 56% at pH = 7, and then became constant. Based on the above,mentioned results, the carrier has an acceptable in vitro yield and therefore could be chosen for future in vivo researches. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: This review discusses fundamental requirements for the optimal formulation of the magnetic carrier, current applications and potentially new approaches for the magnetically mediated, site-specific localization of therapeutic agents, including drugs, genes and cells. Results/conclusion: More efficient targeting magnetic systems in combination with prolonged circulation lifespan and carriers' surface recognition properties will improve the targeting efficiency of magnetic nanocarriers and enhance therapeutic agent availability at the molecular site of agent action.

The nonspecific binding of a model protein (ovalbumin, OVA) and the maximum loading of the respective analytes to these prepared surfaces were monitored using label-free and time-resolved reflectometric interference spectroscopy (RIfS).

They compete with the well-introduced fluorescence-based methods. However, recent applications take advantage of label-free detection in protein-protein interactions, high-throughput screening, and high-content screening. These new applications require new strategies for biosensors. It becomes more and more obvious that neither the transduction principle nor the recognition elements for the biomolecular interaction process alone determine the quality of the biosensor. Accordingly, the biosensor system has to be considered as a whole. This chapter focuses on strategies to optimize the detection platform and the biomolecular recognition layer. It concentrates on direct detection methods, with special focus on optical transduction. Since even this restriction still leaves a large number of methods, only microrefractometric and microreflectometric methods using planar transducers have been selected for a detailed description and a listing of applications. However, since many review articles on the physical principles exist, the description is kept short. Other methods are just mentioned in brief and for comparison.

SAW sensors are shown to be extremely useful for the analysis of both small and large molecules as well as whole cells interacting with an immobilized binding partner. The output signal gives information about the pure mass loading, intrinsic properties of bound materials, or viscoelastic effects like structural rearrangements. Different setups are shown that minimize the influence of physical bulk effects on the sensor signal, e.g. salt content and viscosity. The choice of materials which can be used for sensible surfaces are presented, enabling the development of completely new coupling chemistries. Finally, the advantages compared to other biosensor technologies are pointed out. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

If the bio-degradation process is managed in a way that there is an optimal moisture, oxygen and feedstock supply, a kind of bacteria - thermophilic - proliferate, and their metabolism processes can increase the biomass temperature to over 70 degrees C. However, the optimal temperature for these bacteria is about 60 degrees C, so the excess heat energy should be removed and could be used for heating. The purpose of this paper is to present a review of state of art of available technologies and research papers for heat recovery from aerobic bio-degradation. Modelling methods will be applied for theoretical investigation. The conclusions are that heat recovery from aerobic bio-degradation is not a well explored field and only a few papers are available where a prototype or experiments are presented exactly on heat recovery technologies from bio-degradation. On the other hand the process of biodegradation is well explored and some of the technologies for composting purposes use heat recovery to accelerate the process of composting. In the future it would be advisable to research and experiment in order to make prediction models for bacteria behaviour if the parameters are changed, and be able to automate the process.

The complexities of cell cell communication and the possibilities for modulation provide new opportunities for treating cancers. Cells communicate by direct and indirect signaling. Direct cell-cell communication involves both, self-self-communication (intracrine and autocrine), and adjacent communication with nearby cells (juxtacrine), which themselves are regulated by distinct pathways. Indirect intercellular communication involves local communication over short distances (paracrine and synaptic signaling) or over large distances via hormones (endocrine). The essential components of cell cell communication involve communication junctions (Connexins, Plasmodesmata, Ion Channels, Chemical Synapses, and Pannexins), occluding junctions (Tight Junctions), and anchoring junctions (Adherens, Desmosomes, Focal Adhesions, and Hemidesmosomes). The communication pathways pass through junctions at physical cell cell attachments, and they go, as well, through the extracellular matrix (ECM) via the different transmembrane adhesion proteins (Cadherins and Integrins). We have here reviewed cell cell communication involving (1) the components of junctions and their dynamic interplay with the other aspects of communication, including (2) the tumor microenvironment and carcinogenesis, (3) coupling and migration, (4) the underlying cell cell and sub cellular communication mechanisms (signaling) of anticancer treatments, and finally, (5) aspects of recent research on cell cell communication.

At the core of this framework are the Extended Gaussian Image and area pursuit algorithms, which allow more precise control of the face areas of force polyhedra, and consequently of the magnitudes and distributions of the forces within the structure. The explicit control of the polyhedral face areas enables designers to implement more quantitative, force-driven constraints and it expands the range of 3D graphic statics applications beyond just shape explorations. The significance and potential of this new computational approach to 3D graphic statics is demonstrated through numerous examples, which illustrate how the disjointed force polyhedra enable force-driven design explorations of new structural typologies that were simply not realisable with previous implementations of 3D graphic statics.

The method is a natural generalization of Rankine's reciprocal diagrams for three-dimensional trusses. The vertices and edges of dual abstract 4-polytopes are embedded within dual four-dimensional vector spaces, wherein the oriented area of generalized polygons give all six components (axial and shear forces with torsion and bending moments) of the stress resultants. The relevant quantities may be readily calculated using four-dimensional Clifford algebra. As well as giving access to frame analysis and design, the description resolves a number of long-standing problems with the incompleteness of Rankine's description of three-dimensional trusses. Examples are given of how the procedure may be applied to structures of engineering interest, including an outline of a two-stage procedure for addressing the equilibrium of loaded gridshell rooves.","[McRobie, Allan] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England","McRobie, A (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England.",fam20@cam.ac.uk,NA,NA,EPSRC; Australian Research Council Research Hub; Cambridge University,The author receives a salary from Cambridge University.

The primary aim of our study was to describe the response patterns of patients with refractory CSU treated with omalizumab in a real-world clinical setting. MethodsA retrospective analysis of medical records of 20 patients with refractory CSU was performed. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory features were retrieved and analyzed in correlation with treatment data. ResultsMean age of our patient population was 54.5 years, while the majority were females (15/20 cases, 75%). Mean disease duration prior to omalizumab administration was 21.8 months. All patients had a history of chronic urticaria, refractory to high antihistamine and corticosteroid treatment, and responded favorably to omalizumab after administration of 1-5 doses of omalizumab; complete response was observed in 17/20 patients (85%) and well-controlled disease in the remaining 3/20 patients (15%). In a subset of cases (6/20, 30%), best response to omalizumab was achieved after interval administration of a 9-day course of methylprednisolone (total dose of 188 mg). Late response to omalizumab (after three-month treatment) was significantly correlated (P = 0.026) with shorter disease duration before initiation of omalizumab. ConclusionIn the present series, omalizumab, either alone or in combination with a short-term course of corticosteroids, was highly effective in resolution of refractory CSU. Furthermore, disease duration prior to omalizumab had a significant effect on timing of response.","[Syrigos, Nikolaos; Zande, Maria; Tziotou, Marianna; Syrigou, Ekaterini] Sotiria Gen Hosp, Dept Allergy, Athens, Greece; [Grapsa, Dimitra] Univ Athens, Sch Med, Dept Med 3, Mesogion 152, Athens 11527, Greece","Grapsa, D (reprint author), Univ Athens, Sch Med, Dept Med 3, Mesogion 152, Athens 11527, Greece.",dimgrap@yahoo.gr,NA,NA,NA,NA,18,1,1,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0011-9059,1365-4632,NA,INT J DERMATOL,Int.

Genotype expression and its further correlation with CSU phenotypes are still unknown. We describe the cutaneous transcriptome of patients suffering a severely active CSU refractory to antihistamine treatment. MethodsThrough the bioinformatic analysis of the whole Human Genome with Oligo Microarrays and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), relevant genes expressed in nonlesional (NLS-CSU) and lesional skin (LS-CSU) and peripheral blood were identified in 20 patients suffering from severely active CSU and 10 healthy controls (HCs). ResultsFrom 39 genes differentially expressed in NLS-CSU when compared with HCs, 31 (79.48%) were confirmed by qPCR corresponding to genes involved in epidermal homeostasis and dermal repair. From the analysis comparing LS-CSU with NLS-CSU, a selection of 142 genes was studied with qPCR, and 103 (72.53%) were confirmed. Differentially expressed genes in the phenomenon of wheal development are involved in a variety of biological functions as, epidermal differentiation, intracellular signal function, transcriptional factors cell cycle differentiation, inflammation, or coagulation. Differentially expressed genes that uniformly increase or decrease along the skin worsening until the wheal appearance is shown. ConclusionThe skin of CSU patients with a severely active disease shows an overall immunological skin involvement showing a peculiar gene profile.","[Gimenez-Arnau, A.; Curto-Barredo, L.; Pujol, R.

Patients exhibiting significant clinical improvement showed a sharp reduction in the levels of basophil FceRI after 4 weeks, which was maintained throughout the total duration of the treatment.

Autoimmunity is thought to be one of the most frequent causes of CSU. Type I and II autoimmunity (ie, IgE to autoallergens and IgG autoantibodies to IgE or its receptor, respectively) have been implicated in the etiology and pathogenesis of CSU. We analyzed the relevant literature and assessed the existing evidence in support of a role for type I and II autoimmunity inCSUwith the help of Hill's criteria of causality. For each of these criteria (ie, strength of association, consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient, plausibility, coherence, experiment, and analogy), we categorized the strength of evidence as insufficient, low, moderate, or high and then assigned levels of causality for type I and II autoimmunity in patients with CSU from level 1 (causal relationship) to level 5 (causality not likely). Based on the evidence in support of Hill's criteria, type I autoimmunity in patients with CSU has level 3 causality (causal relationship suggested), and type II autoimmunity has level 2 causality (causal relationship likely). There are still many aspects of the pathologic mechanisms of CSU that need to be resolved, but it is becoming clear that there are at least 2 distinct pathways, type I and type II autoimmunity, that contribute to the pathogenesis of this complex disease.","[Kolkhir, Pavel] LM Sechenov First Moscow State Med Univ, Dept Dermatol & Venereol, Moscow, Russia; [Kolkhir, Pavel; Church, Martin K.; Weller, Karsten; Metz, Martin; Schmetzer, Oliver; Maurer, Marcus] Charite, Dept Dermatol & Allergy, Charitepl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany","Maurer, M (reprint author), Charite, Dept Dermatol & Allergy, Charitepl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",marcus.maurer@charite.de,"Metz, Martin/B-8799-2009","Metz, Martin/0000-0002-4070-9976; Schmetzer, Oliver/0000-0002-9956-2091",German Academic Exchange Service; European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology; FAES Pharma; Almirall; Menarini; MSD; Novartis; UCB Pharma; Sanofi-Aventis; Uriach; UCB; Moxie; Bayer; Genentech,"P.

Omalizumab binds to free IgE, which lowers free IgE levels and causes Fc epsilon RI receptors on basophils and mast cells to be downregulated. It has been shown to improve symptoms of CIU/CSU, but its mechanism of action is not currently understood. Potential mechanisms in CIU/CSU include reducing mast cell releasability, reversing basopenia and improving basophil IgE receptor function, reducing activity of IgG autoantibodies against Fc epsilon RI and IgE, reducing activity of IgE autoantibodies against an antigen or autoantigen that has yet to be definitively identified, reducing the activity of intrinsically abnormal' IgE, and decreasing in vitro coagulation abnormalities associated with disease activity. However, none of these theories alone or in combination fully account for the pattern of symptom improvement seen with omalizumab therapy, and therefore, no one mechanism is likely to be the definitive mechanism of action. Additional research is needed to further clarify the involvement of omalizumab in relieving symptoms associated with the complex, multifactorial pathogenesis of CIU/CSU.","[Kaplan, A.

Omalizumab has been approved for use in asthma, and new reports show promise in a variety of dermatologic diseases. Herein, we review the literature on omalizumab in dermatology and discuss the safety, efficacy and mechanisms of action for this emerging therapy.Materials and methods: PubMED, MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched for the period 1 January 1990 to 1 September 2016. Articles sourced were graded according to the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence Grades of Recommendation criteria.Results: A total of 99 articles met our inclusion criteria. They included reports on the use of omalizumab in chronic spontaneous urticaria, atopic dermatitis, mastocytosis, hyper-IgE syndrome, bullous pemphigoid, Netherton syndrome, urticarial vasculitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.Conclusions: Omalizumab is effective in a variety of recalcitrant immune-mediated and autoimmune skin disorders. It is a safe and effective treatment for use in chronic idiopathic urticaria (Grade of recommendation: A). Randomized clinical trials with long-term follow-ups are warranted to firmly establish the role of omalizumab in the treatment of dermatologic disease.","[Chia, Justin C.; Mydlarski, P.

Omalizumab, an anti-IgE antibody that affects mast cell and basophil function, is a promising new treatment option. As of now, however, the efficacy and safety of different doses of omalizumab used in clinical trials for CSU have not been systematically analyzed and summarized. Objective: We sought to assess the efficacy and safety of different doses of omalizumab for the treatment of CSU in a meta-analysis of clinical trial results. Methods: Suitable trials were identified by searching PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases and with the help of omalizumab's manufacturers. Only double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies with omalizumab-treated versus placebo-treated patients with CSU were included in this analysis. Results: We identified 7 randomized, placebo-controlled studies with 1312 patients with CSU. Patients treated with omalizumab (75-600 mg every 4 weeks) had significantly reduced weekly itch and weekly wheal scores compared with the placebo group. Omalizumab's effects were dose dependent, with the strongest reduction in weekly itch and weekly wheal scores observed with 300 mg. Rates of complete response were significantly higher in the omalizumab group (relative risk, 4.55; P < .00001) and dose dependent, with the highest rates in the 300-mg group. Rates of patients with adverse events were similar in the omalizumab and placebo groups.

In patients receiving 300 mg of omalizumab with 24 weeks of treatment, median time to achieve a UAS7 <= 6 was 6 weeks (ASTERIA I and GLACIAL) and median time to achieve a UAS7 = 0 was 12 or 13 weeks (ASTERIA I and GLACIAL, respectively). Some patients who achieved well-controlled urticaria or complete response sustained response throughout the treatment period. Conclusion: Benefits of omalizumab treatment were evident early (before week 4) in some patients and persisted to week 24.

Specifically, SRRs are computed as a function of the forecasting errors of renewable productions, and of the unavailability rates of the generation units, which are also outputs of the UC.

This is a very complicated task, and with conventional methods, it was difficult to achieve the desired accuracy. Our optimization techniques of searching coefficients space-variant Zernike polynomials can be described as a comprehensive model for ultra-wide-field imaging systems. The advantage of this model is that the model describes the whole space-variant system, unlike the majority models which are partly invariant systems. The issue that this model is the attempt to equalize the size of the modeled Point Spread Function, which is comparable to the pixel size.

While the standard Milankovitch-precession theory fails to explain the long intervals between interglacials, these can be accounted for by a novel forcing and feedback system involving CO2, dust and albedo. During the glacial period, the high albedo of the northern ice sheets drives down global temperatures and CO2 concentrations, despite subsequent precessional forcing maxima. Over the following millennia more CO2 is sequestered in the oceans and atmospheric concentrations eventually reach a critical minima of about 200 ppm, which combined with arid conditions, causes a die-back of temperate and boreal forests and grasslands, especially at high altitude. The ensuing soil erosion generates dust storms, resulting in increased dust deposition and lower albedo on the northern ice sheets. As northern hemisphere insolation increases during the next Milankovitch cycle, the dust-laden ice-sheets absorb considerably more insolation and undergo rapid melting, which forces the climate into an interglacial period. The proposed mechanism is simple, robust, and comprehensive in its scope, and its key elements are well supported by empirical evidence.

Upon deposition of dust, its dissolution can provide an important source of a range of nutrients, particularly iron, to microbes living in open ocean surface waters. The dust supply is greatest nearest to deserts, hence in the Northern Hemisphere. The Southern Ocean region is farthest from these dust sources and shows clear evidence that phytoplankton primary production is limited, at least in part, by the rate of supply of iron. Iron is also essential for nitrogen fixation. In regions of high atmospheric iron supply, such as the tropical North Atlantic, stimulation of nitrogen fixation drives the phytoplankton population toward a state in which phosphorus supply rates limit primary production. Atmospheric deposition is also an important source of nitrogen to the low latitude ocean, where it stimulates primary production. In this review we consider the sources, transport, and deposition of atmospheric dust/iron and nitrogen to the oceans and their impacts on plankton systems. In conclusion, we suggest key areas for future research.","[Jickells, Tim] Univ E Anglia, Ctr Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Moore, C.

Accurate diagnosis and quantification of helminth infection are critical for informing and assessing deworming interventions. The Kato-Katz thick smear technique, the most widely used laboratory method to quantitatively assess infection prevalence and infection intensity of helminths, has often been compared with other methods. Only a few small-scale studies, however, have considered ways to improve its diagnostic sensitivity. This study, conducted among 4,985 school-age children in an area of rural China with moderate prevalence of helminth infection, examines the effect on diagnostic sensitivity of the Kato-Katz technique when two fecal samples collected over consecutive days are examined and compared with a single sample. A secondary aim was to consider cost-effectiveness by calculating an estimate of the marginal costs of obtaining an additional fecal sample. Our findings show that analysis of an additional fecal sample led to increases of 23%, 26%, and 100% for Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworm prevalence, respectively. The cost of collecting a second fecal sample for our study population was approximately USD4.60 per fecal sample. Overall, the findings suggest that investing 31% more capital in fecal sample collection prevents an underestimation of prevalence by about 21%, and hence improves the diagnostic sensitivity of the Kato-Katz method. Especially in areas with light-intensity infections of soil-transmitted helminths and limited public health resources, more accurate epidemiological surveillance using multiple fecal samples will critically inform decisions regarding infection control and prevention.","[Liu, Chengfang] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, China Ctr Agr Policy, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Lu, Louise] Yale Univ, Sch Med, New Haven, CT USA; [Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resource Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Bai, Yu] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Expt Econ Educ, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Lu, Louise; Medina, Alexis; Rozelle, Scott] Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Rural Educ Action Program, Stanford, CA USA; [Smith, Darvin Scott] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zhou, Changhai; Zang, Wei] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Parasit Dis, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Liu, CF (reprint author), Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, China Ctr Agr Policy, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",cfliu.ccap@pku.edu.cn; louise.lu@yale.edu; lxzhang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn; someonebai@gmail.com; amedina5@stanford.edu; rozelle@stanford.edu; dscottsmith@gmail.com; zhouchanghai2005@126.com; zangwei0624@hotmail.com,NA,NA,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473240, 71333012]; International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3IE) [PW2.04.02.02]","The authors acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 71473240 and 71333012), and the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3IE, grant number PW2.04.02.02).",25,0,1,1,4,AMER SOC TROP MED & HYGIENE,MCLEAN,"8000 WESTPARK DR, STE 130, MCLEAN, VA 22101 USA",0002-9637,1476-1645,NA,AM J TROP MED HYG,Am.

Therefore, this study's aim was to develop management recommendations, based on easily interpreted conclusions that can be used to address the socio-ecological difficulties that the artisanal, bottom-longline fishery in Bejuco, Pacific coast of Costa Rica faces. The results of previously recorded fisher socio-ecological perceptions and an evaluation of the spotted rose snapper's, Lutjanus guttatus, population dynamics were assigned a measurable set of indicators in reference to the fishery's natural, human and management sub-systems. This was done via the traffic light method with easily interpreted colors based on a review of similar published fisheries studies. According to these results, a stock assessment for the fishery's target species and research to determine the composition and magnitude of the fishery's discarded species were recommended. Fisher economic dependence on bottom-longline activities led to the recommendation to develop alternative livelihood strategies. Also, the promotion of alternative markets and sustainability certification strategies for the snapper fishery are advised. Enlargement of the multi-use marine protected areas within the fishery's grounds and improvement of their management strategies is also recommended. In order for this to occur, improved resource user coordination in the form of a fisher association that has the capability to lobby for increased enforcement of the protected areas from destructive fisheries must be realized. Doing so would aid the development of a local management plan and participatory governance system. Such an initiative would justify the development of community lead marine protected area management regimes.","[Bystrom, Andrew B.] Univ Estatal Distancia, SEP, 474-2050 Mercedes Montes de Oca, San Jose, Costa Rica; [Bystrom, Andrew B.; Wehrtmann, Ingo S.] Univ Costa Rica, Ctr Invest Ciencias Mar & Limnol CIMAR, Unidad Invest Pesquera & Acuicultura UNIP, San Jose 115012060, Costa Rica; [Bystrom, Andrew B.] ARCAE, San Jose 13761011, Costa Rica; [Naranjo-Madrigal, Helven] Univ Nacl, Programa Maestria Ciencias Marinas & Costeras, Apdo 86-3000, Heredia, Costa Rica; [Naranjo-Madrigal, Helven] ALNA SA, Consultant Serv Dept, POB 11401, San Jose, Costa Rica; [Wehrtmann, Ingo S.] Univ Costa Rica, Escuela Biol, San Jose 115012060, Costa Rica","Bystrom, AB (reprint author), Univ Estatal Distancia, SEP, 474-2050 Mercedes Montes de Oca, San Jose, Costa Rica.; Bystrom, AB (reprint author), Univ Costa Rica, Ctr Invest Ciencias Mar & Limnol CIMAR, Unidad Invest Pesquera & Acuicultura UNIP, San Jose 115012060, Costa Rica.; Bystrom, AB (reprint author), ARCAE, San Jose 13761011, Costa Rica.",abystrom1@yahoo.com; helvenn@gmail.com; ingowehrtmann@gmx.de,"Shen, ChengHan/D-1972-2018","Wehrtmann, Ingo/0000-0002-6826-7938",NA,NA,124,0,0,4,11,REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL,SAN JOSE,"UNIVERSIDAD DE COSTA RICA CIUDAD UNIVERSITARIA, SAN JOSE, 00000, COSTA RICA",0034-7744,2215-2075,NA,REV BIOL TROP,Rev.

Our study determined that CAD research has been classified and categorized according to disease type and imaging modality. This classification began with the CAD of mammograms and eventually progressed to that of brain disease. Furthermore, based on our results, we discuss future directions and opportunities for CAD research. First, in contrast to the typical hypothetical approach, the data-driven approach has shown promise. Second, the normalization of the test datasets and an evaluation method is necessary when adopting an algorithm and a system.

The most commonly used summary statistics of persistent homology are the barcode and the persistence diagram. Another summary statistic, the persistence landscape, was recently introduced by Bubenik. It is a functional summary, so it is easy to calculate sample means and variances, and it is straightforward to construct various test statistics. Implementing a permutation test we detect conformational changes between closed and open forms of the maltose-binding protein, a large biomolecule consisting of 370 amino acid residues. Furthermore, persistence landscapes can be applied to machine learning methods. A hyperplane from a support vector machine shows the clear separation between the closed and open proteins conformations. Moreover, because our approach captures dynamical properties of the protein our results may help in identifying residues susceptible to ligand binding; we show that the majority of active site residues and allosteric pathway residues are located in the vicinity of the most persistent loop in the corresponding filtered VietorisRips complex.

Besides the bulk concentration parameters, a suite of DOM quality parameters were investigated, including colored DOM (CDOM), fluorescent DOM, and the molecular weight of DOM as well as associated dissolved iron concentrations. We observed significant deviations from conservative mixing at low salinities (<2) in the estuarine samples of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV absorption (a((CDOM254))), and humic-like fluorescence. The maximum deviation from conservative mixing for DOC concentration was -16%, at salinities between 1 and 2. An associated laboratory experiment was conducted where an artificial salinity gradient between 0 and 6 was created. The experiment confirmed the findings from the estuarine transects, since part of the DOC and dissolved iron pools were transformed to particulate fraction (>0.2 mu m) and thereby removing them from the dissolved phase. We also measured flocculation of CDOM, especially in the UV region of the absorption spectrum. Protein-like fluorescence of DOM decreased, while humic-like fluorescence increased because of salt-induced flocculation. Additionally, there was a decrease in molecular weight of DOM. Consequently, the quantity and quality of the remaining DOM pool was significantly changed after influenced to flocculation. Based on these results, we constructed a mechanistic, two-component flocculation model. Our findings underline the importance of the coastal filter, where riverine organic matter is flocculated and exported to the sediments.","[Asmala, Eero; Autio, Riitta; Kaartokallio, Hermanni; Thomas, David N.] Finnish Environm Inst, Marine Res Ctr, Helsinki, Finland; [Asmala, Eero] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Roskilde, Denmark; [Bowers, David G.; Thomas, David N.] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge, Gwynedd, Wales","Asmala, E (reprint author), Finnish Environm Inst, Marine Res Ctr, Helsinki, Finland.",eeas@dmu.dk,"Thomas, David/B-1448-2010","Thomas, David/0000-0001-8832-5907; Asmala, Eero/0000-0002-9150-1227",Academy of Finland [127097]; Walter and Andree de Nottbeck Foundation,"The data for this paper are available upon request from the author.

In a highly dynamic estuarine environment, bacterial growth and activity are regulated by multiple factors including the availability of organic carbon, inorganic nutrient concentrations, salinity and temperature. The variability of estuarine bacterial communities in relation to environmental factors and dissolved organic matter (DOM) quantity and quality was studied in three Baltic Sea estuaries with different catchment characteristics, flow and mixing regimes. The work was conducted during six consecutive seasons over 2 years. Bacterial activity, biomass and cytometric cell population characteristics were studied against an suite of environmental parameters and DOM quality and quantity (Salinity, DOC, DON and DIN concentration, SUVA(254), UV Slope(275-295), Fluoresecence peaks A and T, and Apparent mean molecular weight). Environmental variables and DOM quality varied significantly between rivers, indicating influence of catchment characteristics. Bacterial biomass varied significantly between the sampling seasons, and bacterial production also varied between the rivers, indicating an influence of DOM quality on bacterial activity. Based on cytometric grouping into low- and high- nucleic acid bacterial populations (LNA and HNA, respectively) salinity-dependent and salinity-independent clusters of bacterial variables were identified. The results suggest that the LNA clusters were not directly dependent on salinity, but possibly linked to humic substance degradation, whereas the HNA clusters were linked to salinity-correlated environmental variables reflecting DOM quality. Mixed-effects regression modeling of bacterial biomass turnover time suggests DOM fluorescence properties to be useful proxies of bioavailability. Our study shows that growth and community dynamics of estuarine bacteria may be partially regulated by quality of riverine DOM, and cytometric sub-populations of estuarine bacteria have differing regulative factors.",NA,NA,NA,"Thomas, David/B-1448-2010","Thomas, David/0000-0001-8832-5907; Asmala, Eero/0000-0002-9150-1227",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1015-1621,1420-9055,NA,NA,NA,JUL,2016,78,3,NA,NA,NA,525,540,NA,10.1007/s00027-015-0449-9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000377360200009,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The biomass consists mainly of residual forest biomass derived from forestry operations and wood waste from industrial processes, in particular paper and pulp industry. Its quality and composition is influenced by the presence of moisture and inert fragments, the latter being incorporated during collection or as a consequence of adherence to the biomass prior to collection. This variability presents difficulties for the thermal power plants; besides being an additional operational cost, the presence of large amounts of water and inerts in biomass used as a fuel, can result in problems related to the instability of the combustion and the accumulation of ash or rock that have to be removed and discarded. The objective of this paper is to review the main parameters that influence the quality of biomass, while analysing the current state-of-the-art power generation from the biomass sector in Portugal, as a new contribution to earlier studies.","[Nunes, L.

A full parametric study of the amount and size distribution of particle emissions from solid fuel combustion have been performed using a drop tube furnace (DTF). Different operating conditions have been experimented for coals or biomass, including combustion atmosphere (air or oxy-fuel conditions), particle residence time and temperature. First, the gas atmosphere has a significant effect on PM1 emissions from coal combustion but not from biomass combustion. Second, when the particle residence time increases, the amount of PM1 tends to increase with biomass combustion but to decrease with coal combustion. Third, increasing temperature during biomass combustion tends to increase ultrafine particle emissions such as PM0.1. Fourth, the type of coal greatly affects the PM1 emissions during combustion. Finally, coal co-burning with biomass optimizes the amount of PM1 emitted when the biomass mass ratio is around 25% in the blend.

Laboratory experiments were performed to calibrate the hydrogen signal measured by laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) in a range applicable to martian data. The analyses indicate that all veins targeted so far at Gale consist predominantly of bassanite which most likely formed by dehydration of gypsum. This scenario suggests that the percolating water produced gypsum, possibly by hydration of anhydrite in aqueous solution, and remained at temperatures below 60 degrees C at that time. Desiccating conditions followed, consistent with a hyperarid climate and favored by burial or impacts.

Our result suggests bassanite is likely found in the veins and anhydrite may be more common as a fine-grained component within the sediments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This material is relatively expensive and difficult to discard after use. In some countries, mulching is done with the use of organic material that could have an advantage over the use of plastic for its easier degradation after use, and for favoring edaphic beneficial organisms. Predatory mites (especially Gamasina, Mesostigmata) may be abundant in the soil and could conceivably move to the soil surface and onto the short-growing strawberry plants at night, helping in the control or pest arthropods. The two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, is considered an important strawberry pest in that region, where the fungus Neozygites floridana (Weiser and Muma) has been found to infect it. Different mulching types could affect the incidence of this pathogen. Dehydrated coffee husk and pulp (DCHP) is a byproduct readily available in southern Minas Gerais, where could be used as organic mulching in strawberry beds. The temporary contact of that material with the soil of a patch of natural vegetation could facilitate its colonization by edaphic predatory mites helpful in the control of strawberry pests. The objective of this work was to study the effect of mulching type on the population dynamics of the two-spotted spider mite, associate mites and N. floridana, in a greenhouse and in the field. The use of DCHP increased the number of edaphic Gamasina on strawberry plantsProctolaelaps pygmaeus (Muller) (Melicharidae) and Blattisocius dentriticus (Berlese) (Blattisociidae) were observed on strawberry leaflets, mainly in nocturnal samplings, indicating their possible daily migration from soil to plants. Lower levels of two-spotted spider mite occurred on plants from pots or soil beds mulched with DCHP instead of polyethylene film, possibly because of the slightly higher levels of mites of the family Phytoseiidae and infection by N. floridana. Adding DCHP onto the floor of natural vegetation did not result in higher diversity or levels of gamasine mites on DCHP. Complementary studies should be conducted to find ways to increase diversity and density of those organisms in strawberry beds, in an attempt to improve biological control of strawberry pests. The decision to use DCHP for mulching should also take into account other factors such as strawberry yield, costs and efficiency of weed management, to be evaluated in subsequent studies.","[Neves Esteca, Fernanda de Cassia; Rodrigues, Luis Rodolfo; de Moraes, Gilberto Jose; Delalibera Junior, Italo] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, Dept Entomol & Acarol, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Klingen, Ingeborg] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res NIBIO, POB 115, N-1431 As, Norway","Esteca, FDN (reprint author), Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, Dept Entomol & Acarol, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil.",fernanda.esteca@usp.br; luis.rrodrigues@hotmail.com; moraesg@usp.br; delalibera@usp.br; ingeborg.klingen@nibio.no,NA,NA,CAPES (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior Brasil) [001]; Research Council of Norway through SMART-CROP project [244526],We are grateful to Camila do N.

The TE was cocktail of trace metals composed of Fe, Ni, Zn, Co, Mn, Mo, Se W and B. The organic loading rate (OLR) was increased stepwise from 2.5 (HRT = 40 d) to 6.0 kg VS m(-3) d(-1)(HRT = 16.7 d). The highest methane productivity from pulp with and without TE was 1.272 and 0.965 m(3) m(-3) d(-1) at an OLR of 6.0 and 5.0 kg VS m(-3) d(-1); while the husks performed 0.895 and 0.795 m(3) m(-3) d(-1) respectively, both at an OLR of 6.0 kg VS m(-3) d(-1). The specific methane yield(SMY) of pulp (atOLR = 5 kg VS m(-3) d(-1)) with and without TEs was 217.9 +/- 4.7 and 193.1 +/- 8.2 L kg(-1) VS; while husk yielded 149.2 +/- 6.0 and 132.5 +/- 4.9 L kg(-1) VS, respectively. The effect of TEs on SMY was statistically significant (p < 001) at higher OLRs (5.0 - 6.0 kg VS m(-3) d(-1)). The TEs improved the anaerobic stability through an optimum alkalinity ratio (VFA/TIC < 0.3) and suppressed the accumulation of volatile fatty acids. Mono digestion of husks and pulp are prone to lack Mo, Zn, Ni and Fe in long-term anaerobic fermentation.

Furthermore, thickening LD in BGP contributes to the efficient utilization of waste heat and also reduces fossil fuel consumption that is needed for transporting LD. However, the utilization of vacuum evaporation must be reasonable, and a comprehensive study should precede the integration of evaporation technology in a particular BGP. For this purpose, this study compares selected parameters of three types of industrial evaporators which may be suitable for LD thickening. Furthermore, this study provides a mathematical model that describes the mass and energy balances of the chosen evaporators and is able to evaluate their energy performance for a given set of input variables. It was concluded that the forced-circulation evaporator has the highest energy requirements and also requires a high cooling performance. This type of evaporator will be interesting for the plant owners only if the cost of power generation is extremely low. In terms of consumption of energy and cooling duty, the multi-stage flash evaporator is the most efficient and it also requires the least heat transfer area.

Macroscopic models reproduce the evolution of aggregated traffic characteristics over time and space with respect to observable variables, such as flow and speed, requiring much less computational time, compared to microscopic ones. This work assesses a second-order macroscopic gas-kinetic traffic flow (GKT) model and its numerical implementation using real traffic data from a motorway network in the U.K., where recurrent congestion originated from high on-ramp flows during the morning peak hours is observed.

Recently, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) fetal blood levels were reported as useful after 22 weeks. Objective: To determine the contribution of fetal blood GGTP levels after 22 weeks, based on 2 cases. Case 1: 20(+4) week secundipara, with subcutaneous edema and pleural effusion. At 24(+4) weeks, the gallbladder could not be visualized. Progressive hydrops deterioration was observed. 32(+2) - week magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed nonvisualization of the gallbladder. BA was suspected. The patient decided to terminate the pregnancy and fetal blood sample was obtained at feticide. GGTP was 573 IU/L. Fetal necropsy confirmed BA. Case 2: At the 22(+6) - and 24(+0) - week ultrasound scan, the gallbladder could not be visualized. Amniocentesis was offered, but declined by the patient. MRI at 35(+0) weeks failed also to visualize it. Fetal cord blood sample at delivery was obtained, and GGTP was 129 IU/L. Ultrasound confirmed gallbladder agenesis with normal ex tra- and intrahepatic bile ducts. Conclusion: Cases of nonvisualized gallbladder after 22 weeks have rarely been reported in the literature. Until now, no standard management has been proposed. Our cases support the potential usefulness of fetal blood digestive enzymes. (C) 2017 S.

We aimed at assessing the latitudinal effect on both dissolved and particulate forms of elements in snow and quantifying the impact of atmospheric input to element storage and export fluxes in inland waters of the WSL. The concentration of dissolved+colloidal (< 0.45 mu m) Fe, Co, Cu, As and La increased by a factor of 2 to 5 north of 63 degrees N compared to southern regions. The pH and dissolved Ca, Mg, Sr, Mo and U in snow water increased with the rise in concentrations of particulate fraction (PF). Principal component analyses of major and trace element concentrations in both dissolved and particulate fractions revealed two factors not linked to the latitude. A hierarchical cluster analysis yielded several groups of elements that originated from alumino-silicate mineral matrix, carbonate minerals and marine aerosols or belonging to volatile atmospheric heavy metals, labile elements from weatherable minerals and nutrients. The main sources of mineral components in PF are desert and semi-desert regions of central Asia. The snow water concentrations of DIC, Cl, SO4, Mg, Ca, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Cd, Sb, Cs, W, Pb and U exceeded or were comparable with springtime concentrations in thermokarst lakes of the permafrost-affected WSL zone. The springtime river fluxes of DIC, Cl, SO4, Na, Mg, Ca, Rb, Cs, metals (Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb), metalloids (As, Sb), Mo and U in the discontinuous to continuous permafrost zone (64-68 degrees N) can be explained solely by melting of accumulated snow. The impact of snow deposition on riverine fluxes of elements strongly increased northward, in discontinuous and continuous permafrost zones of frozen peat bogs. This was consistent with the decrease in the impact of rock lithology on river chemical composition in the permafrost zone of the WSL, relative to the permafrost-free regions. Therefore, the present study demonstrates significant and previously underestimated atmospheric input of many major and trace elements to their riverine fluxes during spring floods. A broader impact of this result is that current estimations of river water fluxes response to climate warming in high latitudes may be unwarranted without detailed analysis of winter precipitation.",NA,NA,NA,"Vorobyev, Sergey/J-1474-2016; Krickov, Ivan/C-9827-2017; Politova, Nadezhda/Q-9968-2016; Kolesnichenko, Larisa/O-4074-2017; Kirpotin, Sergey/E-4095-2014; Kopysov, Sergey/N-8043-2014; Zemtsov, Valeriy/D-3106-2013","Politova, Nadezhda/0000-0002-4484-9458; Zemtsov, Valeriy/0000-0002-9376-1073; Shevchenko, Vladimir/0000-0002-9045-297X; Manasypov, Rinat/0000-0001-5191-2817; Kritskov, Ivan/0000-0001-8818-0496; Pokrovsky, Oleg/0000-0002-3155-7069",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1027-5606,1607-7938,NA,NA,NA,17-Nov,2017,21,11,NA,NA,NA,5725,5746,NA,10.5194/hess-21-5725-2017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000415764300002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study documents the distribution of living benthic foraminifera under the influence of multiple environmental stressors in the Skagerrak-Baltic Sea region. Sediment core tops were studied at five sites along a transect from the Skagerrak to the Baltic Sea, with strong environmental gradients, especially in terms of salinity, pH, calcium carbonate saturation and dissolved oxygen concentration in the bottom water and pore water. We found that living foraminiferal densities and species richness were higher at the Skagerrak station, where the general living conditions were relatively beneficial for Foraminifera, with higher salinity and Omega(calc) in the water column and higher pH and oxygen concentration in the bottom and pore water. The most common species reported at each station reflect the differences in the environmental conditions between the stations. The dominant species were Cassidulina laevigata and Hyalinea balthica in the Skagerrak, Stainforthia fusiformis, Nonionella aff. stella and Nonionoides turgida in the Kattegat and N. aff. stella and Nonionellina labradorica in the Oresund. The most adverse conditions, such as low salinity, low Omega(calc), low dissolved oxygen concentrations and low pH, were noted at the Baltic Sea stations, where the calcareous tests of the dominant living taxa Ammonia spp. and Elphidium spp. were partially to completely dissolved, probably due to a combination of different stressors affecting the required energy for biomineralization. Even though Foraminifera are able to live in extremely varying environmental conditions, the present results suggest that the benthic coastal ecosystems in the studied region, which are apparently affected by an increase in the range of environmental variability, will probably be even more influenced by a future increase in anthropogenic impacts, including coastal ocean acidification and deoxygenation.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0377-8398,1872-6186,NA,NA,NA,MAR,2018,139,NA,NA,NA,NA,42,56,NA,10.1016/j.marmicro.2017.11.004,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000428101000003,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As Delta n(0) increases, the swing period becomes shorter. But, by increasing of waveguide width, this swing period become larger. For even well numbers except for N = 6, oscillations is not symmetric around the oscillation center. Thus, systems with well numbers N = 2 and N = 4 is not suitable for waveguide applications.

For the propagation of a single soliton beam in a ramp waveguide, the particle theory shows that the soliton beam follows a parabolic curve in the region where the linear refractive index increases and a straight line outside the waveguide. The acceleration of the soliton depends on the beam intensity: higher amplitude solitons experience higher acceleration. Numerical calculations using an implicit Crank-Nicolson scheme confirm the result of the particle theory. Combining these propagation properties with the theory about bound-N-soliton, we study the break up of such a bound-N-soliton in a ramp waveguide. In a ramp waveguide, a bound-N-soliton will always be splitted into N independent solitons with the higher amplitude soliton emitted first. The amplitude of the separated solitons after break up are calculated using the soliton theory as if the solitons are independent.

For this purpose, all-optical logic elements are expected as a promising solution. In this paper, structures of new all-optical logic elements using a nonlinear medium with its index of refraction varying with the optical intensity are proposed and their properties are analyzed. Most of the all-optical logic elements based on nonlinear materials proposed to date either make use of more than two wavelengths or require a specific phase condition (such as 0degrees or 180degrees) for combined lightwaves with identical wavelengths. It is extremely difficult to fix the phase difference between the two lightwaves to be combined. This is a, significant problem in practical fabrication. In this paper, all optical logic elements are proposed in which only one wavelength is used and no specific phase relationship is required. For the numerical analysis, the FD-BPM (Finite Difference Beam Propagation Method) based on the Pade (1, 1) approximation is used.

This work adapts the predictive performance of two well-known statistical machine modeling tools, gradient boosting and random forest regression, to predict future cattle growth. Time series analysis techniques are then used to create an ensemble method that further improves prediction accuracy from individual modeling outputs. Hierarchical clustering techniques are used to leverage projected growth patterns to increase group homogeneity when assigning cattle to different feeding pens. Finally, a profit maximization method is developed that estimates the optimal time each individual cattle should remain in the system under different revenue and cost estimates. The purpose of this work is to incentivize the implementation of modern statistical learning tools in cattle management operations, especially within low-to-mid scale operations that traditionally rely on the expertise of its workers and have limited cattle and process information. Access to 'off-the-shelf statistical learning tools, requiring minimal user-interaction, not only enhances prediction accuracy but helps automate operational decisions. This results in higher process efficiencies and improved standardization practices, while also helping identify profit opportunities. Finally, integrating these components into a single operating framework allows the tool to adapt to changes in data characteristics, which is especially important within non-standardized processes. We show the application of this tool through a case study implementation on a mid-scale operation in the northwestern state of Sonora, Mexico. From our case-study results, it was found that the modeling tool can satisfactorily predict growth patterns based on a low-dimensional set. It also can also capture historic decision making when segmenting cattle into homogenous groups during their feeding process. Furthermore, it can help identify profit opportunities when estimating optimal cattle system times under varying market conditions.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0168-1699,1872-7107,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2017,143,NA,NA,NA,NA,273,285,NA,10.1016/j.compag.2017.10.026,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000418976100027,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As far as the slag and hull, are being used as additives for the asphalt and concretes, however its use still is restricted, reason why its use in alternative ways are necessary. Initially the chemical composition of residues was established, determining that the fly ashes contains SiO2, Al2O3 and Fe2O3 oxides; 90% of the total composition, was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. As minor constituents, small percentages of Mg, P, S, K, Na and Ti were found. For the slag case, the phases of Fe3O4, Ca3Mg (SiO2)(4) and Ca(MgAl)(Si, Al)(2)O-6 were identified, observing the presence of amorphous phase higher than 94% of the total phase of the system. Meanwhile, the glass hull sample showed a higher percentage of 95% amorphicity, mainly identifying a weak signal associated with silicon oxide SiO2. The thermal analyses of the samples, exhibit a decrease in mass for samples between 25-1000 degrees C was observed, which can be attributed to different physical-chemical events that occur in the materials. The heat flow for each sample is related with the removal of the water retained by the physisorption processes around 92-110 degrees C in all cases.

However, in this paper the adverse effects of zinc contamination on solar cell performance in large area systems when using non-optimal processes are demonstrated. Controlled contamination experiments were performed; optical emission spectroscopy allowed us to study the Zn release dynamic; secondary ions mass spectroscopy measurements allowed us to determine the Zn contamination threshold level in a-Si:H solar cells of 10(18) at/cm(3). Higher Zn concentrations lead to loss of cell performance in the initial state and increased light induced degradation compared to cells with lower contamination. Additionally, a simple approach for Zn contamination removal is presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Since the 6-OHDA lesion protocols to induce partial DA depletion in striatum vary extensively between laboratories, we evaluated the associations between different intrastriatal 6-OHDA doses (1X0-20 and 2X0-30 mu g), striatal DA depletion (HPLC-ECD) and D-amphetamine induced rotation to identify a lesion protocol that would produce 40-60% striatal DA depletion. Doses >= 6 mu g produced a significant DA depletion (ANOVA, P<0.0001). 6-OHDA dose range (6-14 mg) causing 40-60% DA depletion induced very variable rotational responses. Next, intrastriatal 1x10 and 1x14 mu g doses were compared with a full lesion (10 mu g into the medial forebrain bundle) with regard to their effects on adjusting step, cylinder, and vibrissae test performance. A combined ipsilateral score (average of each test) was found more sensitive in distinguishing between different lesions than any test alone. Finally, five-week treadmill exercise starting two weeks post-lesion was able to restore impaired limb use (combined score; mixed model, P<0.05) and striatal DA depletion (ANOVA, P<0.05) in rats with partial lesion (1x10 mu g). Notably, D-amphetamine induced rotation significantly decreased between weeks one to seven post-lesion (t-test, P<0.01). In conclusion, intrastriatal 1x10 mu g of 6-OHDA produces 40-60% striatal DA depletion robustly, and the combined ipsilateral score provides an efficient means for testing of the efficacy of neurorestorative or neuroprotective treatments for PD.

In engineering design, individual efforts can be aggregated into teams to maximize collective progress. Effective teamwork, however, requires extensive management, organization and communication. Furthermore, modern challenges encompass complicated multi-disciplinary problems with faster schedules, fewer resources, and greater demands. Design, as a process, can be dissected into characteristic phases. Within each phase, design solutions are gradually developed. Technological tools have prioritized the structured analyses of the detailed and final design phases and have proven to be powerful multipliers for effective design efforts. It has long been the case, however, that major commitments of intangible resources are made as a result of efforts in the less emphasized earlier phases. These commitments and lack of modern toolsets for requirement development and conceptual design activities materialize as major sources of design pitfalls, both in industry and on student design projects. This paper presents a digital Ecosystem for Engineering Design Learning as a comprehensive, yet flexible, framework for capstone design teams. The digital Ecosystem has been developed as a feasible technology to bolster student information management, teamwork, communication, and proficiency in fundamental design principles, and as a technology capable of alleviating rework and process-related productivity interruptions.

Thus, investigating the transcriptional profiles of CTCs might help to identify therapy resistant tumor cells and to overcome treatment failure. For this purpose, we established a multi-marker panel for the molecular characterization of single CTCs, detecting epithelial (EpCAM, Muc-1, CK5/7), EMT (N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snai1/2, CD117, CD146, CD49f) and stem cell (CD44, ALDH1A1, Nanog, SOX2, Notch1/4, Oct4, Lin28) associated transcripts. First primer specificity and PCR-performance of the multiplex-RT-PCRs were successfully validated on genomic DNA and cDNA isolated from OvCar3 cells. The assay sensitivity of the epithelial panel was evaluated by adding defined numbers of tumor cells into the blood of healthy donors and performing a subsequent immunomagnetic tumor cell enrichment (AdnaTest OvarianCancerSelect), resulting in a 100% concordance for the epithelial markers EpCAM and Muc-1 to the AdnaTest OvarianCancerDetect. Additionally, by processing blood from ovarian cancer patients, high assay sensitivity could be verified. In blood of healthy donors no signals for epithelial markers were detected, for EMT and stem cell markers, however, signals were obtained mainly originating from leukocytes which calls for single cell analysis. To that aim by using the ovarian cancer cell line OvCar3, we successfully established a workflow enabling the characterization of single CTCs. It consists of a density gradient dependent enrichment for nucleated cells, a depletion of CD45-positive cells of hematopoietic origin followed by immunofluorescent labeling of CTCs by EpCAM and Muc-1. Single CTCs are then isolated by micromanipulation and processed for panel gene expression profiling. Finally, fifteen single CTCs from three ovarian cancer patients were analyzed and found to be positive for stem cell (CD44, ALDH1A1, Nanog, Oct4) and EMT markers (N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail, CD117, CD146). Albeit, inter-cellular and intra/inter-patient heterogeneity and co-expression of epithelial, mesenchymal and stem cell transcripts on the same CTC was observed. We have established a robust workflow to perform sensitive single cell panel gene expression analysis without the need of pre-amplification steps. Our data point towards a heterogeneous expression of stem cell and EMT associated transcripts in ovarian cancer CTCs. (C) 2016 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Methods: The descriptive analysis used a framework operationalizing Starfield's classic primary care model for health services research. A scoping review was performed using relevant sources, and expert consultations were conducted for completing and validating data. Results: The descriptive analysis presents a complex narrative of a primary care system undergoing classical developmental processes of transitioning middle-income countries. The system is simultaneously under tremendous pressure to adapt to the continuously changing, complex and resource-intensive needs of sub-populations exhibiting varying morbidity patterns, within the context of protracted security, humanitarian, economic, and political crises. Despite exhibiting significant resilience in the face of the ongoing crises, the continued influx of IDPs and Syrian refugees, coupled with extremely limited resources and weak governance at policy, organizational and clinical levels threaten the sustainability of KRI's public primary care system. Diverse trajectories to the strengthening and development of primary care are underway by local and international actors, notably the World Bank, RAND Corporation, UN organizations and USAID, focusing on varying imperatives related to the protracted humanitarian and economic crises. Conclusions: The convergence, interaction and outcomes of the diverse initiatives and policy approaches in relation to the development of KRI's primary care system are complex and highly uncertain. A common vision of primary care is required to align resources, initiatives and policies, and to enable synergy between all local and international actors involved in the developmental and humanitarian response.

The purpose of this work was to develop a method to synthesize computerized tomography (CT) for MR-only radiotherapy of head and neck cancer patients. Methods: The algorithm is based on registration of multiple patient datasets containing both MRI and CT images (a multiatlas algorithm). Twelve matched pairs of good quality CT and MRI scans (those without apparent motion and blurring artifacts) were selected from a pool of head and neck cancer patients to form the atlas. All atlas MRI scans were preprocessed to reduce scanner- and patient-induced intensity inhomogeneities and to standardize their intensity histograms. Atlas CT and MRIs were coregistered using a novel bone-to-air replacement technique applied to the CT scans that improves the similarity between CTs and MRIs and facilitates the registration process. For each new patient, all atlas MRIs are deformed initially onto the new patients' MRI. We introduce a generalized registration error (GRE) metric that automatically measures the goodness of local registration between MRI pairs. The final synthetic CT value at each point is a nonlinear GRE-weighted average of the atlas CTs. For evaluation, the leave-one-out technique was used for synthetic CT generation and the mean absolute error (MAE) between the original and synthetic CT was computed over the entire CT image. The impact of our proposed CT-MR registration scheme on the accuracy of the final synthetic CT was also studied. The original treatment plans were also recomputed on the new synthetic CTs and dose-volume histogram metrics were compared. In addition, the two-dimensional (2D) gamma analysis at 1%/1mm and 2%/2mm dose difference/distance to agreement was also performed to study the dose distribution at the isocenter. Results: MAE error (standard deviation) between the original and the synthetic CTs was 64 +/- 10, 113 +/- 12, and 130 +/- 28 Hounsfield Unit (HU) for the entire image, air, and bone regions respectively. Our results showed that our proposed bone-suppression based CT-MR fusion and GRE-weighted strategy could lower the overall MAE error between the original and synthetic CTs by similar to 69% and similar to 34% respectively. Dose recalculation comparison showed highly consistent results between plans based on the synthetic vs. the original CTs. The 2D gamma analysis revealed the pass rate of 95.44 +/- 2.5 and 99.36 +/- 0.71 for 1%/1mm and 2%/2mm criteria respectively. Due to local registration weighting, the method is robust with respect to MRI imaging artifacts. Conclusion: We developed a novel image analysis technique to synthesize CT for head and neck anatomy. Novel methods were introduced to accurately register atlas CTs and MRIs as well as to weight the final electron density maps using local registration goodness estimates. The resulting accuracy is clinically acceptable, at least for these atlas patients.

Landsat-based water quality hindcasting often incorporate several Landsat sensors in an effort to increase the temporal range of observations; yet the transferability of water quality algorithms across sensors remains poorly examined. In this study, several empirical algorithms were developed to quantify chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter (TSM), and Secchi disk depth (SDD) from surface reflectance measured by Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI sensors. Sensor-specific multiple linear regression models were developed by correlating in situ water quality measurements collected from a semi-arid eutrophic reservoir with band ratios from Landsat ETM+ and OLI sensors, along with ancillary data (water temperature and seasonality) representing ecological patterns in algae growth. Overall, ETM+-based models outperformed (adjusted R-2 chlorophyll-a = 0.70, TSM = 0.81, SDD = 0.81) their OLI counterparts (adjusted R-2 chlorophyll-a = 0.50, TSM = 0.58, SDD = 0.63).

To estimate the chlorophyll content in a leaf, we measured the leaf elongation and related the leaf reflectance to its absorbance. Leaves of the target species were found to start elongating around the middle of April and continued elongation until the middle of May, indicating that April and May in South Korea are the proper period to detect differences in leaf size. Reflectance increased progressively from the first survey date (April 14) to the last survey date (May 16); however, the reflectance became saturated on May 10. There was the possibility to detect within-species and/or among-species variations with temporal changes in leaf reflectance, especially at NIR (near infrared) ranges during the leaf-growing period. Absorbance by a leaf and its trend during the leaf-growing period tended to be contrary to leaf reflectance, and gradually increased with leaf elongation. The chlorophyll content was shown to increase gradually and continuously, regardless of trends in leaf reflectance.

The objective of this research was to develop and evaluate relationships between hyperspectral remote sensing and lake water quality parameters-chlorophyll, turbidity, and N and P species. Proximal hyperspectral water reflectance data were obtained on seven sampling dates for multiple arms of Mark Twain Lake, a large man-made reservoir in northeastern Missouri. Aerial hyperspectral data were also obtained on two dates. Water samples were collected and analyzed in the laboratory for chlorophyll, nutrients, and turbidity. Previously reported reflectance indices and full-spectrum (i.e., partial least squares regression) methods were used to develop relationships between spectral and water quality data. With the exception of dissolved NH3, all measured water quality parameters were strongly related (R-2 >= 0.7) to proximal reflectance across all measurement dates. Aerial hyperspectral sensing was somewhat less accurate than proximal sensing for the two measurement dates where both were obtained. Although full-spectrum calibrations were more accurate for chlorophyll and turbidity than results from previously reported models, those previous models performed better for an independent test set. Because extrapolation of estimation models to dates other than those used to calibrate the model greatly increased estimation error for some parameters, collection of calibration samples at each sensing date would be required for the most accurate remote sensing estimates of water quality.","[Sudduth, Kenneth A.; Lerch, Robert N.; Sadler, E.

The basin is located in northeastern Missouri within the Central Claypan Region, and it is the source of water to Mark Twain Lake, the major public water supply in the region. At the outlet to Mark Twain Lake, the basin drains 6,417 km(2) (2,478 mi(2)), including 10 major water-sheds that range in area from 271 to 1,579 km(2) (105 to 609 mi(2)). The basin is characterized by flat to gently rolling topography with a predominance of claypan soils that result in high runoff potential. The claypan soils are especially vulnerable to soil erosion, which has degraded soil and water quality throughout the basin, and to surface transport of herbicides. Results from cropping system best management practice studies showed that no-till cropping systems did not reduce surface runoff compared to tilled systems, and no-till led to increased transport of soil-applied herbicides. A major challenge is the need to develop cropping systems that incorporate herbicides yet maintain sufficient crop residue cover to control soil erosion. Results of the Soil and Water Assement Tool model simulations showed that the model was capable of simulating observed long-term trends in atrazine concentrations and loads and the impact of grass waterways on atrazine concentrations. Current and future research efforts will continue to focus on best management practice studies, development of needed tools to improve watershed management, and refinements in the calibration and validation of the Soil and Water Assement Tool model.","[Lerch, R.

As tDCS has been shown to modulate event-related desynchronization (ERD), the neural signature of motor imagery detected for neurofeedback, a combination of the techniques was recently proposed. One limitation of this approach is that the area targeted for stimulation is the same from which the signal for neurofeedback is acquired. As tDCS may interfere with proximal electroencephalographic (EEG) electrodes, in this study our aim was to test whether contralateral tDCS could have interhemispheric effects on the spectral power of the unstimulated hemisphere, possibly mediated by transcallosal connection, and whether such effects could be used to enhance ERD magnitudes. A contralateral stimulation approach would indeed facilitate co-registration, as the stimulation electrode would be far from the recording sites. Methods Twenty right-handed healthy volunteers (aged 21 to 32) participated in the study: ten assigned to cathodal, ten to anodal versus sham stimulation. We applied stimulation over the dominant (left) hemisphere, and assessed ERD and spectral power over the non-dominant (right) hemisphere. The effect of tDCS was evaluated over time. Spectral power was assessed in theta, alpha and beta bands, under both rest and MI conditions, while ERD was evaluated in alpha and beta bands. Results Two main findings emerged: (1) contralateral alpha-ERD was reduced after anodal (p = 0.0147), but not enhanced after cathodal tDCS; (2) both stimulations had remote effects on the spectral power of the contralateral hemisphere, particularly in theta and alpha ( significant differences in the topographical t-value maps). Conclusion The absence of contralateral cathodal ERD enhancement suggests that the protocol is not applicable in the context of MI training.

Space heating and cooling and domestic hot water supply represent the biggest share in energy consumed. Despite its low enthalpy content, sewage water - what is seen as a renewable resource could represent an interesting source for energy especially when heat pumps are applied. In the early 1980s, waste (sewage) water source heat pumps (WWSHPs) were widely applied in Sweden and Norway and partially applied in China. Due to the technical development (heat exchangers and heat pumps) and strengthening of environmental considerations in the past two decades, it has become increasingly popular. The heat pump part of the construction does not vary widely but the utilization rate mostly depends on the evolution and design of the heat exchanger side. First, a brief review of wastewater heat exchangers and construction applications is presented. This is followed by a demonstration of Hungarian-developed Thermowatt technology. To make this technology - which utilizes the great potential of densely populated cities - economically feasible, we need to increase the efficiency to minimize the payback period due by the lower operation cost. In this study, the heat transport process is investigated, which is the key element of the system's efficiency. The aim of my study is to improve the technology and increase the system efficiency. By clarifying the complex physical and biological method, biofilm creating and developing, there is opportunity to prevent the emergence of biofilm. The literature research, the measurement in laboratory and the collected information about the operating system shows the magnitude of different physical parameters, and other circumstances. It is concluded that from the two negative effects, physical fouling is stronger than the biofilm created on the inner surface of heat exchanger tubes, but the latter should not be neglected.

Synthetic events were generated for the entire river system of the Scheldt estuary. This estuary contains multiple navigable waterways and is situated in Belgium and the Netherlands. Extreme water levels are influenced by rainfall-runoff discharges, tiding, storm surges, and wind speed and direction. For the generation of hydraulic boundary conditions for flood risk assessment, these influences and their mutual dependencies and correlations are taken into account by means of a nested extreme value copula structure. The variation in time is taken into account by standardized profiles, computed by normalizing all recorded extreme events and fitting a probability distribution to the variation of the standardized events, yielding 5 profile classes through another stratification. Eventually this resulted in a total of 1920 sets of synthetic events. All events were run through the hydrodynamic model of the river system. The frequency distribution of the resulting water levels are calculated by accumulation of the corresponding probabilities of occurrence of the synthetic events at each location.

However, numerous uncertainties remain with respect to the amount of energy generated by wind turbines and other sophisticated operational aspects, such as voltage and reactive power management, which requires further development and consideration. To fix the problem of poor reactive power compensation in wind farms, optimal capacitor placement has been proposed in existing wind farms as a simple and relatively inexpensive method. However, the use of induction generators, transformers, and additional capacitors represent potential problems for the harmonics of a system and therefore must be taken into account at wind farms. The optimal location and size of capacitors at buses of an 80-MW wind farm were determined according to modelled wind speed, system equivalent circuits, and harmonics in order to minimize energy losses, optimize reactive power and reduce the management costs. The discrete version of the lightning search algorithm (DLSA) is a powerful and flexible nature-inspired optimization technique that was developed and implemented herein for optimal capacitor placement in wind farms.

Considering load variations, a comprehensive optimization for capacitor placement is formulated to maximize the net annual returns from network loss reduction and capacity release. A sequential strategy based on loss sensitivity analysis is presented for efficient capacitor placement on large-scale unbalanced distribution networks. Then a capacitor control strategy is proposed to simultaneously minimize network losses, voltage deviations and voltage unbalance factor (VUF) while a weighted sum method reflects the preferences on the mutually conflicting control objectives. For the mixed integer programming (MIP) problems of capacitor placement and control, an improved backward/forward sweep (BSFS) load flow based particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is used.

Considerations of different types of capital give us a more holistic picture of what is at stake. Our decision-making mechanisms and tools must seek to integrate all types of capital, including natural and social capital, if we are to sustain long-term farm performance. Modeling is one way to integrate this 'expanded' notion of capital. While farm modeling is not a new concept, this paper reviews various types of models with the aims of determining which is most suitable to demonstrate the effect of natural and social capital on farm risk, farm resilience, and farm well-being. As an industry particularly vulnerable to extreme weather patterns and other ecological hazards, the concepts of risk and resilience are critical to sustain long-term farm well-being. Various types of farm models are covered in this review, including land use cover and change, agent-based, statistical, system dynamics, and participatory modeling. The paper also identifies key characteristics that assist in modeling the effects of natural and social capital management. I conclude that an integrated, spatially explicit, participatory, systems-based modeling process is suggested to usefully incorporate natural and social capital effects on farm risk, resilience, and well-being. This approach can incorporate a whole systems approach, capture system 'leverage points', and effectively involve affected stakeholders. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We start by highlighting the significance of context in general and spatiotemporal context in particular and introduce a smart city model of interactions between humans, the environment, and technology, with context at the common interface. We then focus on both the intentional and the unintentional sensing capabilities of today's technologies and discuss current technological trends that we consider have the ability to enrich human and technical geo-sensor information with contextual detail. The different types of sensors used to collect contextual information are analyzed and sorted into three groups on the basis of names considering frequently used related terms, and characteristic contextual parameters. These three groups, namely technical in situ sensors, technical remote sensors, and human sensors are analyzed and linked to three dimensions involved in sensing (data generation, geographic phenomena, and type of sensing). In contrast to other scientific publications, we found a large number of technologies and applications using in situ and mobile technical sensors within the context of smart cities, and surprisingly limited use of remote sensing approaches. In this article we further provide a critical discussion of possible impacts and influences of both technical and human sensing approaches on society, pointing out that a larger number of sensors, increased fusion of information, and the use of standardized data formats and interfaces will not necessarily result in any improvement in the quality of life of the citizens of a smart city.

Functionalization of these adsorbents with an organosilane produced NPS-HYCA and NPP-HYCA composite adsorbents. The pH(pzc) for the adsorbents were 7.83, 6.91, 7.66 and 6.55 for iPS-HYCA, NPS-HYCA, iPP-HYCA and NPP-HYCA respectively.

When compared with some commercial resins, the amino-functionalized adsorbents had better adsorption capacities. Furthermore, amino-functionalized adsorbents showed improved adsorption capacity and rate of phosphate uptake (as much as 40-fold), as well as retain 94% (for NPS-HYCA) and 84.1% (for NPP-HYCA) efficiency for phosphate adsorption after 5 adsorption-desorption cycles (96 h of adsorption time with 100 mg/L of phosphate ions) as against 37.5% (for iPS-HYCA) and 35% (for iPP-HYCA) under similar conditions. In 25 min desorption of phosphate ion attained equilibrium. These new amino-functionalized hybrid clay composite adsorbents, which were prepared by a simple means that is sustainable, have potentials for the efficient capture of phosphate ions from aqueous solution. They are quickly recovered from aqueous solution, non-biodegradable (unlike many biosorbent) with potentials to replace expensive adsorbents in the future. They have the further advantage of being useful in the recovery of phosphate for use in agriculture which could positively impact the global food security programme. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The method for the search of the maximum power or MPPT is widely known, and there are many offered algorithm solutions. The aim of this paper is to present ANFIS (Adaptive Neural Fuzzy System Inference) as a method of computer intelligence in the search function of maximum power or maximum utilization of the PV system, without prior knowledge of the system. MPPT ANFIS will be located between the PV panels and devices for voltage regulation. Inputs used to go inside the fuzzy regulators and outputs of the fuzzy regulators are going into power changing device. The advantage of this method is the low cost of implementation because it uses embedded computer systems and does not require additional sensors for measuring temperature and insolation.

The objective of this work is to apply unsupervised learning methods to multilayer PWC configurations to improve performance providing a basis for more advanced applications and deep learning. Previous work on defining multilayer PWC configurations is extended by applying biologically inspired learning methods to dynamically suppress unneeded transponders and improve configuration performance. Simple learning approaches based on concepts from spike-timing-dependent plasticity and potentiation decay models are adapted to PWC transponders and combined with training sequences to optimize the transponder configurations for recognition. Learning is further enhanced by configuring transponders in recurrent structures to activate hidden layer transponders creating reverberations that reinforce learning. A means to classify multiple input patterns into general concepts is also introduced to further enhance the recognition capabilities of the configurations. The concepts are experimentally validated and analyzed through application to a 7-segment display digit recognition problem showing that the approach can improve PWC configuration performance and reduce complexity.

Here we investigate whether persistence in inflammatory status affects changes in physical function during short-term hospitalization. Methods: This was a prospective observational study in elderly medical patients at a geriatric department. Measurements were obtained at admission and one week after admission and included de Morton Mobility Index (DEMMI) test, 30-second chair stand test (30-s CST), 4-m gait speed (4-m GST) test, handgrip strength, activity levels determined with ActivPALs, and concentrations of circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) from blood samples. Only patients with inflammation (C-reactive protein levels >= 10 mg.L-1) at admission were included in this study. They were divided into those with continued inflammation (CI: CRP remained >= 10 mg.L-1) and those that became non-inflammatory (BN: CRP decreased to< 10 mg.L-1) after one week of admission. Results: On admission 214 patients (67% female) with a median (IQR) age of 86 (81-91) years were categorized as inflammatory. There were no baseline differences in physical function between CI (n = 138, 67% female) and BN (n = 76, 68% female). DEMMI-score increased similarly in both groups (P < 0.05). When normalized to days between tests, only changes in handgrip strength were significantly different between the CI- and BN-group (-0.05 [-0.27-0.28] vs. 0.16 [-0.10-0.41] kg.day(-1), respectively, P < 0.01). There was a positive association between changes in CRP and length of hospital stay (r(s) = 0.30, P < 0.001).

TCP Friendly Rate Control protocol is an efficient rate control for streaming media applications in the wired network. The standard TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC) with Additive Increase - Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) schema wastes the bandwidth and it may react to congestion when the packet loss has occurred.

In this work, an integration of a Real Option model with the Robust Optimization technique is presented. This approach aims to eliminate the shortcomings of robust optimization for sequential decision making problems. We provide an example of applying this new integrated model to the operational control of a single reservoir of the Oregon Washington Columbia River system by optimizing the flexibility of the system. Flexibility for an engineering system is the ease with which the system can respond to uncertainty in a manner to sustain or increase its value delivery through decision-making. In this paper, we define flexibility as the amount of water left in the storage reservoir to produce electricity after meeting demand. Real Option analysis is an economic tool which helps to value the multiple courses of actions in a decision: that is to either sell the flexibility or hold it for future use based upon the future value of flexibility. Selling flexibility causes one to lose some future value because one may be forced to repurchase that flexibility from the market at higher prices later due to shortages; Real Options analysis values future purchases to support decision-making. Robust optimization focuses on for selling the flexibility in a daily market and gives an optimal result by maximizing net revenue, considering all the physical and operational constraints of the reservoir to avoid floods or other environmental calamities. Net revenue is defined as cost of selling and cost of future purchase of the flexibility. We provide an optimization result of 27 random inflow scenarios which gives high, medium and low flexibility to allocate using the integrated model. We compare the optimal solutions given by the integrated model with that given by robust optimization. The integrated real option-robust optimization model improves the revenue from allocating flexibility as much as 40 percent over the robust optimization result.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2159-7383,NA,978-0-7918-5813-4,NA,NA,NA,2017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,UNSP V02BT03A045,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000423243900045,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

HPV vaccination uptake turned out to be lower than expected: 61% versus 70%, respectively. Mothers were shown to play the most important role in the immunization decision about this vaccination. They had also expressed their need for interactive personal information about the HPV vaccination over and above the existing universal general information. To improve the effectiveness of the existing education about the HPV vaccination, we systematically developed a Web-based tailored intervention with virtual assistants providing mothers of girls to be invited with tailored feedback on their decision making about the HPV vaccination. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Web-based tailored intervention for promoting HPV vaccination acceptance by means of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods: Mothers were recruited via the Dutch vaccination register (Praeventis) (n=36,000) and three Web-based panels (n=2483). Those who gave informed consent (N=8062) were randomly assigned to the control (n=4067) or intervention condition (n=3995). HPV vaccination uptake, as registered by Praeventis once the HPV vaccination round was completed, was used as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were differential scores across conditions between baseline (before the provided access to the new tailored intervention) and follow-up (just before the first vaccination) regarding the mothers' degree of informed decision making (IDM), decisional conflict, and critical determinants of HPV vaccination uptake among which are intention, attitude, risk perception, and outcome beliefs. Results: Intention-to-treat analysis (N=8062) showed a significant positive effect of the intervention on IDM, decisional conflict, and nearly all determinants of HPV vaccination uptake (P<.001). No effect was found on uptake (P=.60). This may be attributed to the overall high uptake rates in both conditions. Mothers evaluated the intervention as highly positive, including the website as well as the virtual assistants that were used to deliver the tailored feedback. Conclusions: This computer-tailored intervention has the potential to improve HPV vaccination acceptability and IDM and to decrease decisional conflict among mothers of invited girls.

However, partial nitrification has been hindered by the complexity of maintaining stable nitrite accumulation at high nitrogen loading rates (NLR) which affect the feasibility of the process for high nitrogen content wastewater. Thus, the operational data of a lab scale SBR performing complete partial nitrification as a first step of nitrite shunt process at NLRs of 0.3-1.2 kg/(m(3) d) have been used to calibrate and validate a process model developed using BioWin (R) in order to describe the long-term dynamic behavior of the SBR. Moreover, an identifiability analysis step has been introduced to the calibration protocol to eliminate the needs of the respirometric analysis for SBR models. The calibrated model was able to predict accurately the daily effluent ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, alkalinity concentrations and pH during all different operational conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This makes it difficult to reduce the problem to a single-objective optimisation. Furthermore, when disruptive changes emerge in manufacturing environments, such as the arrival of new jobs or machine breakdowns, the scheduling system should be adapted by responding quickly. In this paper, we propose a rescheduling architecture for solving the problem based on a predictive-reactive strategy and a new method to calculate the reactive schedule in each rescheduling period. Additionally, we developed a methodology that allows the use of multi-objective performance metrics to evaluate dispatching rules. These rules are applied at a benchmark specifically designed for this paper considering three objective functions: makespan, total weighted tardiness and stability. Three types of disruptions are also considered: arrivals of new jobs, machine breakdowns and variations in job processing times. Results showed that the RANDOM rule provides a better behaviour compared to other evaluated rules and a lower ratio of non-dominated solutions compared to ATC (apparent tardiness cost) and FIFO (first-in-first-out) rules. Moreover, the behaviour of the hypervolume metric depends on the problem dimensions.","[Valledor, Pablo] ArcelorMittal, Global R&D Asturias, Gijon, Spain; [Gomez, Alberto; Priore, Paolo; Puente, Javier] Univ Oviedo, Dept Business Adm, Polytech Sch Engn, Gijon, Spain","Puente, J (reprint author), Univ Oviedo, Dept Business Adm, Polytech Sch Engn, Gijon, Spain.",jpuente@uniovi.es,NA,NA,NA,NA,66,1,1,4,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,NA,INT J PROD RES,Int.

Using statistical clustering (k-means and Ward's method), five meaningful clusters of countries with similar level of greenhouse gases emission were identified. Neural modeling using multi-layer perceptron networks was performed for countries placed in particular groups. The parameters that characterize the quality of a network are the predictive errors (mainly validation and test) and they are high (0.97-0.99). The use of sensitivity analysis allowed for identifying the variables that have a significant influence on the greenhouse gases emissions. The sensitivity analysis of the designed artificial neural network models shows a few dominant variables, affecting emissions with varied intensity: cattle and buffaloes, sheep and goat populations, afforestation as well as electricity consumption. The observed values were compared with those predicted by the models. The forecasted course of changes in the variable test is identical with the real data, which proves that the model highly matches to the observed data.","[Kolasa-Wiecek, Alicja] Univ Opole, Dept Proc Engn, Fac Nat Sci & Technol, 7-9 Dmowskiego Str, PL-45365 Opole, Poland","Kolasa-Wiecek, A (reprint author), Univ Opole, Dept Proc Engn, Fac Nat Sci & Technol, 7-9 Dmowskiego Str, PL-45365 Opole, Poland.",akolasa@uni.opole.pl,NA,"Kolasa-Wiecek, Alicja/0000-0002-5842-7280",NA,NA,42,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0049-6979,1573-2932,NA,WATER AIR SOIL POLL,Water Air Soil Pollut.,JUN,2018,229,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,205,10.1007/s11270-018-3861-7,NA,NA,NA,12,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources,GJ6ME,WOS:000435497500020,NA,NA,NA,NA,11/12/2018

For any organization, it is critical that confidential and proprietary data is sufficiently secured to address both legal and contractual obligations. The changing nature of security attacks has caused a surge of interest in anomaly detection mechanisms. Such mechanisms are suitable as they can dynamically adapt to changed network conditions and threats without security personnel intervention. While anomaly detection mechanisms have significant potential, they are technically limited. Many anomaly detection approaches are unsuitable for real time environments. The approaches also typically operate based on what is common is normal. Mechanisms are typically singular in focus analysing data on one specific type. This paper proposes a novel framework to detect anomalies previously hidden within current detection techniques. The approach is easily extensible taking input from many security assessment applications; network traffic, asset criticality. Using time based correlations with historic data; a method for generating a normalized view of activity on the network is achieved. Once normality has been established for specific time intervals an extensible environment is implemented which allows for the active monitoring of anomalies in real-time. Anomalies which had sufficient commonality to remain undetected by other mechanisms are identified and analysed. The proposed solution is completely autonomous, capable of acting independently with no previous knowledge required.

Our findings showed that at 21 degrees C the electron transport system and antioxidant enzyme activity, as well as the expression of Hsp70 gene were induced in R. decussatus when compared with 17 degrees C. On the other hand, at 25 degrees C results suggested that R. decussatus closed their valves during short periods, as a behavioral strategy, down-regulating the expression of genes associated with mitochondrial metabolism (Cox-1 and 16S) and chaperone function (Hsp70) compared with organisms at 17 degrees C. In addition, the introduced species (R. philippinarum) increased the electron transport system and antioxidant activities, as well as gene expression of antioxidant enzymes and molecular chaperone (Hsp70) at 21 degrees C. However, antioxidant mechanisms were not enough to prevent lipid membrane damages at 21 degrees C.

The capacity of positron emission tomography with [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose to detect the changes in cardiac metabolism caused by sunitinib was dependent on fasting status and duration of treatment.

Especially the quality inspection of the overall system at the end of the production is of extraordinary importance. The associated inspection equipment can also be a mechatronic system, which is often explicitly designed and manufactured for one product with a large expenditure of time. In order to have the needed inspection equipment ready by the start of production (SoP) and to consider additional requirements to the product, which are produced by the inspection equipment concept, an integrative mechatronic product and inspection equipment development procedure is needed. Furthermore, the inspection system has to consider the modularity of the system and often has to be designed in a modular way. Nowadays, the development of complex mechatronic systems is often carried out with the help of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) methods. Consequently, the inspection equipment should also be designed with the help of MBSE.

ABI patients usually stop receiving cognitive treatment when leaving the rehabilitation facility or shortly thereafter, due to the high cost of therapy sessions and the mobility requirement to access therapy. Software solutions offer a promising tool for accessible and affordable cognitive rehabilitation in the home environment. However, research provides limited evidence for effective transfer of benefits from computerized cognitive training to real-life functions. Virtual reality (VR) exergames using motion-interaction offer a more realistic and natural training environment, and are therefore expected to facilitate a more effective transfer. Although commercial exergames may bring about some cognitive gains, they usually do not target cognitive functions directly. Here we describe a novel exergames platform, the Active Brain Trainer (ABT), designed to directly target EF, using games in multiple realistic contexts. The software adapts in real-time to the patient's behavior, providing feedback and rewards, and hence may enhance usability and compliance. The primary goal of the current study is to assess the feasibly and acceptability of this platform for community-dwelling ABI patients during the chronic phase. A secondary goal is to assess the initial efficacy on EF and functional benefits from program training. Participants were instructed to use the games for 15-20 sessions. Neuropsychological assessments of EF and daily life functions were performed before and after training. Participants also filled a satisfaction questionnaire following training. All training and assessments were conducted in the participants' homes. Game performance was recorded throughout training sessions. Preliminary results from the six ABI patients who successfully completed the program so far show no adverse effects. Participants reported enjoyment and satisfaction from training. Participants performed increasingly more challenging EF tasks within game environments. Initial results show improvements in functional tasks and most executive neuropsychological assessments following training. Additional participants are currently being trained to increase the power of the results. These preliminary findings support the feasibility and potential efficacy of the motion-based cognitive training of EF for community-dwelling individuals with ABI.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,978-1-5090-3053-8,NA,NA,NA,2017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000411111900075,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Besides disadvantages such as possible ion damage and high operation costs especially the characteristically small removal rates represent a bottleneck for this application. In contrast, femtosecond lasers provide material removal rates orders of magnitude higher, with small or ideally without thermal impact on the surrounding material. Hence, a combination of these two methods offers an ideal tool for time-efficient, micrometer-sized sample preparation. A prototype implementing this idea is presented here in combination with a case study. Cantilevers with a length of several hundred micrometers were machined into 25 pm, 50 pm and 100 pm thick, cold rolled tungsten foils. Scanning electron microscopy analyses reveal the influence of laser parameters and different scanning routines on the resulting sample quality and the effect of the laser pulse length (femtoseconds versus nanoseconds) on the ultra-fine grained microstructure. Finally, the performance for unprecedented rapid sample preparation is demonstrated with a sample array consisting of 100 cantilevers with a dimension of 420x60x25 mu m(3) processed in only half an hour, opening completely new testing possibilities.

In this work, an integration of a Real Option model with the Robust Optimization technique is presented. This approach aims to eliminate the shortcomings of robust optimization for sequential decision making problems. We provide an example of applying this new integrated model to the operational control of a single reservoir of the Oregon Washington Columbia River system by optimizing the flexibility of the system. Flexibility for an engineering system is the ease with which the system can respond to uncertainty in a manner to sustain or increase its value delivery through decision-making. In this paper, we define flexibility as the amount of water left in the storage reservoir to produce electricity after meeting demand. Real Option analysis is an economic tool which helps to value the multiple courses of actions in a decision: that is to either sell the flexibility or hold it for future use based upon the future value of flexibility. Selling flexibility causes one to lose some future value because one may be forced to repurchase that flexibility from the market at higher prices later due to shortages; Real Options analysis values future purchases to support decision-making. Robust optimization focuses on for selling the flexibility in a daily market and gives an optimal result by maximizing net revenue, considering all the physical and operational constraints of the reservoir to avoid floods or other environmental calamities. Net revenue is defined as cost of selling and cost of future purchase of the flexibility. We provide an optimization result of 27 random inflow scenarios which gives high, medium and low flexibility to allocate using the integrated model. We compare the optimal solutions given by the integrated model with that given by robust optimization. The integrated real option-robust optimization model improves the revenue from allocating flexibility as much as 40 percent over the robust optimization result.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2159-7383,NA,978-0-7918-5813-4,NA,NA,NA,2017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,UNSP V02BT03A045,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000423243900045,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the melt state, tau(A) increases in a nonlinear manner as temperature T decreases toward blend glass transition temperature T-g((blend)) (or toward the local effective glass transition temperature of its component Tg(A)) this is the typical a relaxation process. For temperatures below the transition, 1/tau A exhibits an Arrhenius temperature dependence; this is identified as the a' process. A third relaxation process, a so-called alpha o process, also occurs in the melt state; it is slower than the a process and exhibits a significantly stronger dependence on temperature.

Recently, microfabrication has been largely applied to solve health and pharmaceutical science issues. In particular, fabrication methods along with compatible materials have been successfully designed to produce multifunctional, highly effective drug delivery systems. Microfabrication offers unique tools that can tackle problems in this field, such as ease of mass production with high quality control and low cost, complexity of architecture design and a broad range of materials. Presented is an overview of silicon-and polymer-based fabrication methods that are key in the production of microfabricated drug delivery systems. Moreover, the efforts focused on studying the biocompatibility of materials used in microfabrication are analyzed. Finally, this review discusses representative ways microfabrication has been employed to develop systems delivering drugs through the transdermal and oral route, and to improve drug eluting implants.

These include avoidance of presystemic metabolism, absence of gastric irritation and enzymatic degradation, convenience, painlessness, non-invasiveness and improved patient compliance [3-6]. Despite these advantages, it is challenging to deliver molecules across the skin. Researchers have used external force to drive compounds through the skin. Several strategies are used to achieve this goal including chemical penetration enhancers, sonophoresis, iontophoresis and microneedles. Microneedles are micrometer-sized needles that are used to porate the skin for drug delivery. These needles are long enough to penetrate the stratum corneum but too short to stimulate pain receptors that are located in the dermis. Considerable progress has been made in the design and development of microneedles. Several strategies have been adopted for the fabrication of different types of microneedles. This paper reviews the strategies used in developing micorneedles and outcomes from clinical trials. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Skin viscoelasticity was assessed using a rheometer, and microneedle geometry was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Permeation studies of vismodegib through dermatomed porcine ear skin were conducted using vertical Franz diffusion cells. Skin irritation potential of vismodegib formulation was assessed using an in vitro reconstructed human epidermis model. Results of the in vitro permeation studies revealed significant enhancement in permeation of vismodegib through microneedle- treated skin.

Considering the scale of taxi traces data, Hadoop is employed to handle the traces data, whose tasks include filtering and cleaning of the data, mapping taxi traces, and computing the average passage time and empty taxi arrival rate on the roads. When a user uploads his position and the time, assisted by weather condition gain from the Internet, we get the very model that corresponds to the date and the weather; the time interval is thought to be the expected waiting time between the moment when user requests the service and the moment when the cumulative number of empty taxi is greater than or equal to 1 after adding the time the taxi spends on the road, and is pushed to the user. The experiment is conducted on the base of a real-world dataset generated by over 12,000 taxis over a period of 3 months in Beijing. Experimental results demonstrate that the processing speed of Hadoop is nine times faster than serial's, which displays the feasibility of Hadoop in the application of massive traces data.

When detecting recently developed adaptive image steganography methods, state-of-art steganalysis methods cannot achieve satisfactory detection accuracy, because the adaptive steganography methods can adaptively embed information into regions with rich textures via the guidance of distortion function and thus make the effective steganalysis features hard to be extracted. Inspired by the promising success which convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved in the fields of digital image analysis, increasing researchers are devoted to designing CNN based steganalysis methods. But as for detecting adaptive steganography methods, the results achieved by CNN based methods are still far from expected. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach by designing a region selection method and a new CNN framework. In order to make the CNN focus on the regions with complex textures, we design a region selection method by finding a region with the maximal sum of the embedding probabilities. To evolve more diverse and effective steganalysis features, we design a new CNN framework consisting of three separate subnets with independent structure and configuration parameters and then merge and split the three subnets repeatedly. Experimental results indicate that our approach can lead to performance improvement in detecting adaptive steganography.","[Hu, Donghui; Shen, Qiang; Zhou, Shengnan; Liu, Xueliang; Fan, Yuqi] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Comp & Informat, Hefei 230009, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lina] Wuhan Univ, Sch Comp & Informat, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China","Hu, DH (reprint author), Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Comp & Informat, Hefei 230009, Anhui, Peoples R China.",hudh@hfut.edu.cn,NA,NA,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [U1536204, 61672386]; Natural Science Research Project of Colleges and Universities in Anhui Province [KJ2017A734]",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grants nos.

This pooling method intends to assign failure probability density (FPD) values to pixel points in image feature domains after projection of image eigenvectors from high to low dimensions to maintain the relationship of highly dimensional image features. As a result, feature mapping of some samples approximated failure probability, and residual samples featured low risk of failing. Optimization was implemented according to this idea and was realized by setting the threshold value of FPD to reserve high-quality features. Different from traditional pooling method based on CNN, the pooling method proposed in this study is based on failure probability theory, and it was used as basis for construction of CNN structure. Image classification tests on three kinds of image datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN) were respectively conducted. Afterward, comparisons were made on experimental accuracy and speed obtained through three relatively popular pooling methods (i.e., dropout-pooling, maxout-pooling, and stochastic-pooling). Research results indicated that pooling model based on failure probability theory featured scientific derivation without the need for empirical parameters and presented the most accurate results in experiments on three kinds of image in training data and test data.

However, the majority of the existing tongue image analyses and classification methods are based on the low-level features, which may not provide a holistic view of the tongue. Inspired by deep convolutional neural network (CNN), we propose a novel feature extraction framework called constrained high dispersal neural networks (CHDNet) to extract unbiased features and reduce human labor for tongue diagnosis in TCM. Previous CNN models have mostly focused on learning convolutional filters and adapting weights between them, but these models have two major issues: redundancy and insufficient capability in handling unbalanced sample distribution. We introduce high dispersal and local response normalization operation to address the issue of redundancy. We also add multiscale feature analysis to avoid the problem of sensitivity to deformation. Our proposed CHDNet learns high-level features and provides more classification information during training time, which may result in higher accuracy when predicting testing samples. We tested the proposed method on a set of 267 gastritis patients and a control group of 48 healthy volunteers. Test results show that CHDNet is a promising method in tongue image classification for the TCM study.","[Meng, Dan; Cao, Guitao; Zhu, Minghua] East China Normal Univ, MOE Res Ctr Software Hardware Codesign Engn, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Cao, Guitao; Duan, Ye; Tu, Liping; Xu, Dong] Univ Missouri, Dept Comp Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Tu, Liping] Shanghai Univ TCM, Dept TCM Informat & Technol Ctr, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jiatuo] Shanghai Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Dept Basic Med Coll, 1200 Cailun Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China","Cao, GT; Zhu, MH (reprint author), East China Normal Univ, MOE Res Ctr Software Hardware Codesign Engn, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.; Cao, GT (reprint author), Univ Missouri, Dept Comp Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",gtcao@sei.ecnu.edu.cn; mhzhu@sei.ecnu.edu.cn,NA,NA,"NSFC-Zhejiang Joint Fund for the Integration of Industrialization and Informatization [U1609220]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61375015, 81373556, 61572061]","This work was supported in part by the NSFC-Zhejiang Joint Fund for the Integration of Industrialization and Informatization under Grant no.

The proposed approach employs several convolutional and pooling layers to extract deep features from HSIs, which are nonlinear, discriminant, and invariant. These features are useful for image classification and target detection. Furthermore, in order to address the common issue of imbalance between high dimensionality and limited availability of training samples for the classification of HSI, a few strategies such as L2 regularization and dropout are investigated to avoid overfitting in class data modeling. More importantly, we propose a 3-D CNN-based FE model with combined regularization to extract effective spectral-spatial features of hyperspectral imagery. Finally, in order to further improve the performance, a virtual sample enhanced method is proposed. The proposed approaches are carried out on three widely used hyperspectral data sets: Indian Pines, University of Pavia, and Kennedy Space Center.

The quality of 3D visual experience is one of the most challenging areas of human binocular perception and is affected by multiple factors such as asymmetric stereo image/video compression, depth perception, visual discomfort, and single view quality. In this paper, we propose a new no-reference quality assessment method for stereoscopic images based on Binocular Self-similarity (BS) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). To be more specific, a BS index is defined and computed according to binocular rivalry and suppression based on the depth image-based rendering technique. Then, a DNN is trained in an opinion unaware way to predict local quality. Binocular integration (BI) index is calculated by using the trained DNN, accounting for binocular integration behaviors. Finally, the final quality score of stereoscopic image is obtained by combining the BS and BI indexes together. Experimental results on four public 3D image quality assessment databases demonstrate that compared with existing methods, the proposed method can achieve high consistency with subjective perception on stereoscopic images with both symmetric and asymmetric distortions.

However, TFDS is simply responsible for capturing, transmitting, and storing images, and fails to recognize faults automatically due to some difficulties such as such as the diversity and complexity of faults and some low quality images. To improve the performance of automatic fault recognition, it is of great importance to locate the potential fault areas. In this paper, we first introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to TFDS and propose a potential fault region detection system (PFRDS) for simultaneously detecting four typical types of potential fault regions (PFRs). The experimental results show that this system has a higher performance of image detection to PFRs in TFDS. An average detection recall of 98.95% and precision of 100% are obtained, demonstrating the high detection ability and robustness against various poor imaging situations.","[Sun, Junhua; Xiao, Zhongwen] Beihang Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China","Sun, JH (reprint author), Beihang Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",sjh@buaa.edu.cn,NA,NA,NA,NA,10,0,0,3,7,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,NA,978-1-5106-0772-9; 978-1-5106-0773-6,PROC SPIE,NA,NA,2016,10157,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,101571L,10.1117/12.2246551,NA,NA,NA,8,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Robotics; Remote Sensing; Optics",Engineering; Robotics; Remote Sensing; Optics,BG7DE,WOS:000391228600056,NA,NA,NA,NA,12/10/2018

However, shortage of medical resources is a critical global problem. As a result, an intelligent prognostics system has a great potential to play important roles in computer aided diagnosis. Numerous papers reported that tongue features have been closely related to a human's state. Among them, the majority of the existing tongue image analyses and classification methods are based on the low-level features, which may not provide a holistic view of the tongue. Inspired by a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), we propose a deep tongue image feature analysis system to extract unbiased features and reduce human labor for tongue diagnosis. With the unbalanced sample distribution, it is hard to form a balanced classification model based on feature representations obtained by existing low-level and high-level methods. Our proposed deep tongue image feature analysis model learns high-level features and provide more classification information during training time, which may result in higher accuracy when predicting testing samples. We tested the proposed system on a set of 267 gastritis patients, and a control group of 48 healthy volunteers (labeled according to Western medical practices). Test results show that the proposed deep tongue image feature analysis model can classify a given tongue image into healthy and diseased state with an average accuracy of 91.49%, which demonstrates the relationship between human body's state and its deep tongue image features.","[Meng, Dan; Cao, Guitao; Duan, Ye] East China Normal Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Software Engn, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Minghua; Tu, Liping] Univ Missouri, Dept Comp Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Xu, Jiatuo; Xu, Dong] Shanghai Univ TCM, Dept TCM Informat, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jiatuo; Xu, Dong] Shanghai Univ TCM, Ctr Technol, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Cao, GT (reprint author), East China Normal Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Software Engn, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.; Zhu, MH (reprint author), Univ Missouri, Dept Comp Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",gtcao@sei.ecnu.edu.cn; mhzhu@sei.ecnu.edu.cn,NA,NA,Natural Science Foundation of China [61375015],This work was supported by Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61375015).,20,0,0,0,2,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",2156-1125,2156-1133,978-1-5090-1610-5,IEEE INT C BIOINFORM,NA,NA,2016,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1918,1922,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Medical Informatics",Computer Science; Medical Informatics,BG9GY,WOS:000393191700330,NA,NA,NA,NA,12/10/2018

A recent significant breakthrough in using deep neural networks as function approximators, termed Deep Q-Networks (DQN), proves to be very powerful for solving problems approaching real-world complexities such as Atari 2600 games. To remove temporal correlation between the observed transitions, DQN uses a sampling mechanism called experience reply which simply replays transitions at random from the memory buffer. However, such a mechanism does not exploit the importance of transitions in the memory buffer. In this paper, we use prioritized sampling into DQN as an alternative. Our experimental results demonstrate that DQN with prioritized sampling achieves a better performance, in terms of both average score and learning rate on four Atari 2600 games.","[Zhai, Jianwei; Liu, Quan; Zhang, Zongzhang; Zhong, Shan; Zhu, Haijun; Zhang, Peng; Sun, Cijia] Soochow Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Suzhou 215000, Peoples R China","Liu, Q (reprint author), Soochow Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Suzhou 215000, Peoples R China.",20144227023@stu.suda.edu.cn; quanliu@suda.edu.cn,NA,NA,NA,NA,8,3,3,1,11,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,NA,978-3-319-46687-3; 978-3-319-46686-6,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,NA,NA,2016,9947,NA,NA,NA,NA,13,22,NA,10.1007/978-3-319-46687-3_2,NA,NA,NA,10,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Computer Science,BG5XU,WOS:000389805900002,NA,NA,NA,NA,12/10/2018

Although most of used existing intelligent methods extracting the features of original hyperspectral data are based on shallow-layer networks such as neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) for its simplicity in realization, two deep neural networks (DNN), i.e. the deep convolutional network (DCN) and the deep belief network (DBN), have been used for HSI classifications with improved performance, as deep learning recently achieves great success for its ability in deep feature extraction and representations. In this paper, another DNN, a deep stacking network (DSN) based approach with coarse features for hyperspectral image classification is proposed, as its advantages over shadow networks and other deep models in its simplicity and batch-mode learning - not requiring stochastic gradient descent that other DNNs require. In this approach, the inputs to the DSN are coarse features, i.e. coarse spectral features by band reduction, coarse spatial features extracted by PCA from original HSI, or combination of both. The fine deeper features in the hyperspectral data are gradually obtained by employing the nonlinear activation function on the hidden layer nodes of each module, which is different from the current DSN that usually uses linear weights between hidden layer to output layer. A closed limit on its node's input - output is also exerted. The theoretical analysis and experimental results with AVIRIS hyperspectral image have shown that, (1) the proposed DSN approach achieves improved classification performance compared with shadow networks, (2) the new DSN approach with both the coarse spectral feature and coarse spatial feature has higher classification accuracy compared to that with either only, (3) this study has insight of necessity to develop new deep neural network for HSI classification from direct HSI data.","[He, Mingyi; Li, Xiaohui] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Earth Observat Ctr, Sch Elect & Informat, Shaanxi Key Lab Informat Acquisit & Proc, Xian 710129, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","He, MY (reprint author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Earth Observat Ctr, Sch Elect & Informat, Shaanxi Key Lab Informat Acquisit & Proc, Xian 710129, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",myhe@nwpu.edu.cn,NA,NA,National Natural Science Foundation of China [61420106007],This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (project number 61420106007).,15,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",NA,NA,978-1-5090-0608-3,NA,NA,NA,2016,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6,"Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing",Physical Geography; Remote Sensing,BJ5JF,WOS:000425944200011,NA,NA,NA,NA,12/10/2018

Hydrogel-forming polypeptides are widely found in nature and, at a cellular and organismal level, they provide a wide range of functions for the organism making them. Amyloid structures, arising from polypeptide aggregation, can be damaging or beneficial to different types of organisms. Although the best-known amyloids are those associated with human pathologies, this underlying structure is commonly used by higher eukaryotes to maintain normal cellular activities, and also by microbial communities to promote their survival and growth. Amyloidogenesis occurs by nucleation-dependent polymerisation, which includes several species (monomers, nuclei, oligomers, and fibrils). Oligomers of pathological amyloids are considered the toxic species through cellular membrane perturbation, with the fibrils thought to represent a protective sink for toxic species. However, both functional and disease-associated amyloids use fibril cross-linking to form hydrogels. The properties of amyloid hydrogels can be exploited by organisms to fulfil specific physiological functions. Non-physiological hydrogelation by pathological amyloids may provide additional toxic mechanism(s), outside of membrane toxicity by oligomers, such as physical changes to the intracellular and extracellular environments, with wide-spread consequences for many structural and dynamic processes, and overall effects on cell survival.","[Jean, Letitia; Foley, Alex C.; Vaux, David J.
